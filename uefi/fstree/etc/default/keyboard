# The following variables describe your keyboard and can have the same
# values as the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions options
# in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="us,il"
XKBVARIANT=","

# specify an alternative keymap.  Make sure it will be accessible
# before /usr is mounted.
