Since 2.1.99-test5, pciutils should also be compilable on Windows. Thanks
to Alexander Stock for contributing the port.

Updated after version 2.2.6 to compile again, and with MinGW, even (only?)
cross-compiling. (Hopefully it works with MSVC too.)

To use this port, you need to install WinIO.dll first. You can get it
from http://www.internals.com/.

However, you need to use win32/config.{h,mk} instead of the automatically
generated lib/config.{h,mk} as lib/configure does not run on Windows.
