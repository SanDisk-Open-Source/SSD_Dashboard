icu (4.3.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Versions of ICU newer than 4.2 name the static libraries compatibly
    with shared libraries so building with static ICU libraries doesn't
    require special build code anymore.  In versions prior to 4.2, the
    static libraries had an extra "s" in their names.  For details, see
    http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/6332
