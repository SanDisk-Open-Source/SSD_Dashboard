.SH "NAME"
getfscreatecon, setfscreatecon \- get or set the SELinux security context used for creating a new file system object.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B #include <selinux/selinux.h>
.sp
.BI "int getfscreatecon(security_context_t *" con );

.BI "int setfscreatecon(security_context_t "context );

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B getfscreatecon
retrieves the context used for creating a new file system object.
This returned context should be freed with freecon if non-NULL.  
getfscreatecon sets *con to NULL if no fscreate context has been explicitly 
set by the program (i.e. using the default policy behavior).

.B setfscreatecon
sets the context used for creating a new file system object.
NULL can be passed to
setfscreatecon to reset to the default policy behavior.  
The fscreate context is automatically reset after the next execve, so a
program doesn't need to explicitly sanitize it upon startup.  

setfscreatecon can be applied prior to library
functions that internally perform an file creation,
in order to set an file context on the objects.


Note: Signal handlers that perform an setfscreate must take care to
save, reset, and restore the fscreate context to avoid unexpected behavior.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On error -1 is returned.
On success 0 is returned.
