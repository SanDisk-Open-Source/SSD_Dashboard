.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The SELinux policy can include conditional rules that are enabled or
disabled based on the current values of a set of policy booleans.
These policy booleans allow runtime modification of the security
policy without having to load a new policy.  

The SELinux API allows for a transaction based update. So you can
set several boolean values and then commit them all at once.

.B security_load_booleans

loads policy boolean settings. Path may be NULL, in which case the
booleans are loaded from the active policy boolean configuration file.

.B security_get_boolean_names

provides a list of boolean names, currently supported by the loaded policy.

.B security_get_boolean_pending

returns the pending value for boolean or \-1 on failure.

.B security_get_boolean_active

returns the active value for boolean or \-1 on failure.

.B security_set_boolean 

sets the pending value for boolean 

.B security_set_boolean_list

saves a list of booleans in a single transaction.

.B security_commit_booleans

commits all pending values for the booleans.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Where not otherwise stated, functions described in this manual page return
zero on success or \-1 on error.
