libselinux (2.1.0-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Move manpages for privileged commands "setenforce" and "togglesebool" to
    section 8 where they belong.
  * Fix other manpages which refer to "selinuxenabled" and "getenforce" to
    find them in section 1.
  * Convert to Debian source format "3.0 (quilt)".  This allows us to break
    apart the changes-to-upstream into multiple patches with descriptions.
    - fix-makefile-bugs.patch
    - fix-manpages.patch
    - hide-library-destructors.patch
  * Change "Architecture" to "linux-any" to reflect build requirements.
  * Completely rewrite Debian packaging to use debhelper.  This has a very
    positive effect on the build time (97 sec => 64 sec) and dramatically
    reduces the size of the packaging metadata:
      46 files changed, 441 insertions(+), 2833 deletions(-)
    Note that half of the inserted lines are the new broken-out patches.
  * Comply with new Ruby packaging conventions (using gem2deb/dh_ruby)
    - Rename ruby package to "ruby-selinux"
    - Add support for ruby1.9.1
  * Comply with new Python packaging conventions (use dh_python2)

    have used it without causing a crash so there seems no harm in removing it.

libselinux (2.0.89-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [libselinux 16a76cd]: Do not ship /selinux
    Shipping /selinux is a violation of the FHS, and is proscribed by
    Debian policy. There is nothing that actually depends on /selinux
    being present, possibly apart from user scripts. From this point on,
    the machine operator will have to decide where to locate the mount
    point for selinuxfs, and modify /etc/fstab accordingly. SELinux
    modules scan for selinuxfs in /proc/mounts, so everything should
    adjust to the location of the selinuxfs mount automatically.

    * Added swigify to top-level Makefile from Dan Walsh.
    * Fix for string_to_security_class segfault on x86_64 from Stephen
      Smalley.
    * Fix for getfilecon() for zero-length contexts from Stephen Smalley.
    * Refactored SWIG bindings from James Athey.
    * Labeling and callback interface patches from Eamon Walsh.
    * Class and permission mapping support patches from Eamon Walsh.
    * Object class discovery support patches from Chris PeBenito.
    * Refactoring and errno support in string representation code.
    * Merged patch to reduce size of libselinux and remove need for
      libsepol for embedded systems from Yuichi Nakamura.
      This patch also turns the link-time dependency on libsepol into a
      runtime (dlopen) dependency even in the non-embedded case.
    * Updated Lindent script and reindented two header files.
    * Merged additional swig python bindings from Dan Walsh.
  * When selinux_init_load_policy calls mount() it "knows" when selinux is
    not wanted due to being disabled or having no kernel device handle and
    sets *enforce to 0, but still allows the following fprintf to display
    a rather misleading error message. The solution was provided by  Kel
    Modderman, but has been refactored slightly.
                                             Closes: Bug#424011, Bug#447762
  * Reverted the fix for bug#448008 fixed in an NMU, and applied a
    different fix for the issue.  Thanks for the NMU, Clint Adams.

libselinux (1.32-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Bug fix: "python-selinux: package almost empty (except on i386)",
    thanks to Martin Dickopp. Actually, any time the sources are built
    straight from the .dsc, there exists a possibility that that the swig
    output .x file could be older than the source; and while it is
    feasible to use "touch" and md5sums of source files to fix this, it is
    far less kludgy to just build depend on swig. No other changes are
    made, and the swig output is only used by the python-selinux package.
    This fixes a grave bug on python-selinux               (Closes: #395915).

libselinux (1.28-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "libselinux: please include a pkg-config file", thanks to
    Guillem Jover In Debian, dpkg compiles  in libselinux statically -- in
    order to prevent dependency loops. Now, as libselinux acquired a build
    time dependency on libsepol, automated dpkg builds failed -- since
    there was no  way for packages to detect the transitive dependencies
    when linking statically. This patch fixes that issue -- by generating
    a .pc file to be used with pkg-config.
          pkg-config --static --libs libselinux
    libsepol has also been modified to provide a .pc file (Closes: #348961).

libselinux (1.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    * Added MATCHPATHCON_VALIDATE flag for set_matchpathcon_flags() and
      modified matchpathcon implementation to make context validation/
      canonicalization optional at matchpathcon_init time, deferring it
      to a successful matchpathcon by default unless the new flag is set
      by the caller.
    * Added matchpathcon_init_prefix() interface, and
      reworked matchpathcon implementation to support selective
      loading of file contexts entries based on prefix matching
      between the pathname regex stems and the specified path
      prefix (stem must be a prefix of the specified path prefix).
    * Merged getsebool patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Added -f file_contexts option to matchpathcon util.
      Fixed warning message in matchpathcon_init().
    * Merged Makefile python definitions patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Merged swigify patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Merged make failure in rpm_execcon non-fatal in permissive mode
      patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added MATCHPATHCON_NOTRANS flag for set_matchpathcon_flags()
      and modified matchpathcon_init() to skip context translation
      if it is set by the caller.
    * Added security_canonicalize_context() interface and
      set_matchpathcon_canoncon() interface for obtaining
      canonical contexts.  Changed matchpathcon internals
      to obtain canonical contexts by default.  Provided
      fallback for kernels that lack extended selinuxfs context
      interface.
    * Merged seusers parser changes from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged setsebool to libsemanage patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Changed seusers parser to reject empty fields.
    * Merged seusers empty level handling patch from Jonathan Kim (TCS).
    * Changed default entry for seusers to use __default__ to avoid
      ambiguity with users named "default".
    * Fixed init_selinux_config() handling of missing /etc/selinux/config
      or missing SELINUXTYPE= definition.
    * Merged selinux_translations_path() patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Added hidden_proto/def for get_default_context_with_role.
    * Merged selinux_path() and selinux_homedir_context_path()
      functions from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged fixes for make DESTDIR= builds from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged get_default_context_with_rolelevel and man pages from
      Dan Walsh (Red Hat).
    * Updated call to sepol_policydb_to_image for sepol changes.
    * Changed getseuserbyname to ignore empty lines and to handle
    no matching entry in the same manner as no seusers file.
    * Changed selinux_mkload_policy to try downgrading the
    latest policy version available to the kernel-supported version.
    * Changed selinux_mkload_policy to fall back to the maximum
    policy version supported by libsepol if the kernel policy version
    falls outside of the supported range.
    * Changed getseuserbyname to fall back to the Linux username and
    NULL level if seusers config file doesn't exist unless
    REQUIRESEUSERS=1 is set in /etc/selinux/config.
    * Moved seusers.conf under $SELINUXTYPE and renamed to seusers.
    * Added selinux_init_load_policy() function as an even higher level
    interface for the initial policy load by /sbin/init.  This obsoletes
    the load_policy() function in the sysvinit-selinux.patch.
    * Added selinux_mkload_policy() function as a higher level interface
    for loading policy than the security_load_policy() interface.
    * Merged fix for matchpathcon (regcomp error checking) from Johan
    Fischer.  Also added use of regerror to obtain the error string
    for inclusion in the error message.
    * Changed getseuserbyname to not require (and ignore if present)
    the MLS level in seusers.conf if MLS is disabled, setting *level
    to NULL in this case.
    * Merged getseuserbyname patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Merged STRIP_LEVEL patch for matchpathcon from Dan Walsh.
      This allows file_contexts with MLS fields to be processed on
      non-MLS-enabled systems with policies that are otherwise
      identical (e.g. same type definitions).
    * Merged get_ordered_context_list_with_level() function from
      Dan Walsh, and added get_default_context_with_level().
      This allows MLS level selection for users other than the
      default level.

        will not have any context translation by default.
      * Added public functions to export context translation to
        users of libselinux (selinux_trans_to_raw_context,
        selinux_raw_to_trans_context).
      * Remove special definition for context_range_set; use
        common code.
      * Hid translation-related symbols entirely and ensured that
        raw functions have hidden definitions for internal use.
      * Allowed setting NULL via context_set* functions.
      * Allowed whitespace in MLS component of context.
      * Changed rpm_execcon to use translated functions to workaround
        lack of MLS level on upgraded systems.

        with modifications by Dan Walsh (Red Hat).
      * Merged several fixes for error handling paths in the

  * Bug fix: "doesn't compile on ia64", thanks to Andreas

    interface. So, we include a GNU libc excerpt to implement a clone
    look alike for IA64. Thanks to Florian Weimer for the fix.

        * Merged matchpathcon and man page patch from Dan Walsh.
        * Changed boolean functions to return -1 with errno ENOENT
          rather than assert on a NULL selinux_mnt (i.e. selinuxfs not
          mounted).
        * Fixed bug in matchpathcon_filespec_destroy.
        * Fixed bug in rpm_execcon error handling path.
        * Merged fix for set_matchpathcon* functions from Andreas Steinmetz.
        * Merged fix for getconlist utility from Andreas Steinmetz.

          This introduces booleans.local support for setsebool.
        * Merged destructors patch from Tomas Mraz.
        * Added set_matchpathcon_flags() function for setting flags
          controlling operation of matchpathcon.  MATCHPATHCON_BASEONLY
          means only process the base file_contexts file, not
          file_contexts.homedirs or file_contexts.local, and is for use by
          setfiles -c.
        * Updated matchpathcon.3 man page.
