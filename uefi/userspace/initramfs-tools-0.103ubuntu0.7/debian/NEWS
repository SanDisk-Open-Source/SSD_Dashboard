initramfs-tools (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

    To improve boot speed and avoid some complications, video drivers are
    no longer included in the initramfs by default (MODULES=most).

initramfs-tools (0.76) unstable; urgency=low

    This release features nfs auto detection in the initramfs.
    The boot paramaters are parsed according to the linux source
    Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt and more specifically
    Documentation/nfsroot.txt.

    The initramfs-tools(8) manpage documents the parsed boot parameter.
    Note that the undocumented and non compliant nfsoption bootarg got
    dropped.

initramfs-tools (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

    This release moves the initramfs-tools confdir from /etc/mkinitramfs to
    /etc/initramfs-tools. Packages are encouraged to ship files as scripts
    under /usr/share/initramfs-tools.

    Local tests behaved fine, but be warned that this could potentially
    cause boot troubles on upgrade.

initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

    This release includes hardware auto detection in the initramfs.
    This means two things in particular that are important:

    1) the resulting initramfs will be huge.  Like 10 megs huge.
       I will shrink it down once it's correct.  If you're on an
       arch that doesn't like >4mb initramfs', then this won't boot.

    2) Your network drivers are loaded in the initramfs, so hotplug
       won't see a network event, so ifup won't be run.  This will
       be fixed shortly in hotplug.
