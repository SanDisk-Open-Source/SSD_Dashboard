# install, then install them into the staging area, where the
# initramfs is being created.  This happens when a new 'linux-image'
# package is installed, or when the administrator runs 'mkinitramfs'
# by hand to update an initramfs image.
#
#  CONFDIR -- usually /etc/initramfs-tools, can be set on mkinitramfs
#		 command line.

#  DESTDIR -- The staging directory where we are building the image.
