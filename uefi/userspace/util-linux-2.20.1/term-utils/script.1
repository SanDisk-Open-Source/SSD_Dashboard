.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm script
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl t Ns Op Ns = Ns Ar file
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl h
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm script
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file 
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript  .
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a, Fl Fl append
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.It Fl c, Fl Fl command Ar command
Run the
.Ar command
rather than an interactive shell.
This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that
behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.
.It Fl e, Fl Fl return
Return the exit code of the child process.  Uses the same format as bash
termination on signal termination exit code is 128+n.
.It Fl f, Fl Fl flush
Flush output after each write.  This is nice for telecooperation:
one person does `mkfifo foo; script -f foo', and another can
supervise real-time what is being done using `cat foo'.
.It Fl Fl force
Allow the default output destination, i.e. the typescript file, to be a
hard or symbolic link.  The command will follow a symbolic link.
.It Fl q, Fl Fl quiet
Be quiet.
.It Fl t, Fl Fl timing Ns Op Ns = Ns Ar file
Output timing data to standard error, or to \fIfile\fR when given.
This data contains two fields, separated by a space.
The first field indicates how much time elapsed since the previous output.
The second field indicates how many characters were output this time.
This information can be used to replay typescripts with
realistic typing and output delays.
.It Fl V, Fl Fl version
Output version information and exit.
.It Fl h, Fl Fl help
Output help and exit.
.El
.Pp
The script ends when the forked shell exits (a
.Em control-D
to exit
the Bourne shell
.Pf ( Xr sh 1 ) ,
and
.Em exit , 
.Em logout
or
.Em control-d
(if
.Em ignoreeof
is not set) for the
C-shell,
.Xr csh 1 ) .
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
.Nm Script
works best with commands that do not manipulate the
screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy
terminal.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is utilized by
.Nm script :
.Bl -tag -width SHELL
.It Ev SHELL
If the variable
.Ev SHELL
exists, the shell forked by
.Nm script
will be that shell. If
.Ev SHELL
is not set, the Bourne shell
is assumed. (Most shells set this variable automatically).
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1
(for the
.Em history
mechanism),
.Xr scriptreplay 1 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm script
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Script
places
.Sy everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
.Sh AVAILABILITY
The script command is part of the util-linux package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
