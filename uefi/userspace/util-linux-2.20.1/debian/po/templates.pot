"/etc/fstab contains at least one entry that is marked as \"noauto\" with a "
"non-zero pass number (meaning that the file system should not be "
"automatically mounted upon boot, yet should be checked by fsck, the file "
"system check utility)."

"From this release onwards, fsck will fail for file systems that have a non-"
"zero pass number and are not available (eg. because they are unplugged) at "
"the time fsck runs. This will cause the system to enter file system repair "
"mode during boot."

"To avoid this problem, please adjust such fstab entries for removable "
"devices, by either setting their pass number to zero, or adding the \"nofail"
"\" option. For more details, please see mount(8)."
