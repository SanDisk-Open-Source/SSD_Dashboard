mount (2.8a-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload with permision by Vincent
  * Fixed wrong while loop that caused too many lines to be ignored.  The
    code for the whole condition is generated with all variables replaced
    by their values as they were when the condition was entered.  This
    means that if one uses variable assignments, the variable to which a
    new value was assigned still contains the old value later in the same
    condition.  Thanks to Peter Moulder <reiter@netspace.net.au (fixes:
    Bug#27421)
  * Applied patch by James Troup <james@nocrew.org> that prevents mount
    from crashing when an empty argument list is used with `-t'.  (fixes:
    Bug#27130)
