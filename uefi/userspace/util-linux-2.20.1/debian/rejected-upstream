Subject: [patch] setterm -{dump,append} don't work on current virtual console

Hi Andries,

Colin Watson <cjw44@cam.ac.uk> reported the following Problem:

<--  snip  -->

When 'setterm -dump' or 'setterm -append' is called without further
arguments, it tries to dump the current virtual console, using
/dev/vcsa0. Unfortunately, according to the Linux Device List, the
current virtual console text/attribute contents are on /dev/vcsa.

I don't think I'll make this change.

There are several machines here with /dev/vcsa0 and without /dev/vcsa.
So making this change would certainly give slight problems.

One could test both, but I prefer to leave the code as it is.
I consider the Linux Device List broken in this respect -
the vcs naming is exactly analogous to the tty naming, with tty0
on the same major as tty1, and there was no need to change anything.
