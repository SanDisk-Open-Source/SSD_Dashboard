.SH NAME
lscpu \- display information on CPU architecture
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lscpu
.RB [ \-hpx ]
.RB [ \-s
.IR directory ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lscpu
gathers CPU architecture information like number of CPUs, threads,
cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, information about CPU caches, CPU family,
model, bogoMIPS, byte order and stepping from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo, and prints it in
a human-readable format.  It supports both online and offline CPUs.
It can also print out in a parsable format,
including how different caches are shared by different CPUs,
which can be fed to other programs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Print a help message.
.TP
.BR \-p , " \-\-parse " \fI[=list]\fP
Print out in parsable instead of human-readable format.

If the \fIlist\fP argument is not given then the default backwardly compatible
output is printed.  The backwardly compatible format uses two commas to
separate CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches are identified, then the cache
columns are not printed at all.

The \fIlist\fP argument is comma delimited list of the columns. Currently
supported are CPU, Core, Node, Socket, Book and Cache columns. If the
\fIlist\fP argument is given then always all requested columns are printed in
the defined order. The Cache columns are separated by ':'.

Note that the optional \fIlist\fP argument cannot be separated from the
option by a space, the correct form is for example '\fB-p=cpu,node\fP' or '\fB--parse=cpu,node\fP'.
.TP
.BR \-s , " \-\-sysroot " \fIdirectory\fP
Use the specified \fIdirectory\fP as system root.  This allows you to inspect
a snapshot from a different system.
.TP
.BR \-x , " \-\-hex"
Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (e.g. 0x3).  The default is to print the sets
in list format (e.g. 0,1).
.SH BUGS
The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the first
CPU only.

Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
