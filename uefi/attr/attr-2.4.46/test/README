Run `make test` in the root source tree to build the tree and run
FS-independent tests.

Run `cd test; make ext` to run ext specific tests.

Andreas Gruenbacher's tests for the ext2 filesystem extended attributes
support.  Most of these tests should work for any filesystem type, and
most are actually used as part of the XFS test suite.  However, those
tests relating to the exercising of boundary conditions of attribute
value lengths, etc, are specific to ext2.
