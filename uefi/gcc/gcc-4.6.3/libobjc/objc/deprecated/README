This directory contains declarations and features that are deprecated
and that will be removed in future versions of the compiler.

Note that files in this directory are not really usable headers on
their own - they shouldn't be included directly by end users.  They
are header fragments containing deprecated APIs that are still
included (until removed) from the real headers in objc/.

Files in this directory should not #include any other objc header.
Any include that they need should be done in the real objc/ headers
before including these fragments.
