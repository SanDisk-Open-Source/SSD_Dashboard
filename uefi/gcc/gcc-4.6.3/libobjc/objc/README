This directory contains the public headers that are installed when
libobjc is installed.

Deprecated parts of the API should be moved into objc/deprecated and
then included by public headers until they are finally removed.  For
example, if objc-api.h contains an _objc_unexpected_exception variable
which is then deprecated, it should be moved into a header in
objc/deprecated.  This header is then included into objc-api.h.

The result is that all the deprecated parts of the API are clearly
separated in objc/deprecated, while objc/ retains only the current public
API.
