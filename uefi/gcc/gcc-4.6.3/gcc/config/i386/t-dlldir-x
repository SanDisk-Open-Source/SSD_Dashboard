# In a cross build, bindir contains host not target binaries, so target DLLs
# instead go in toolexeclibdir, alongside other target binaries and static libs.
# Note double quoting to prevent variables from being evaluated until install
# time; we don't want to expand them during libgcc.mvars generation, and in
# any case, $toolexeclibdir is not defined in the gcc/ subdirectory, only in
# target lib directories.
