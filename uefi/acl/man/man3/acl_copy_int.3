.Dt ACL_COPY_INT 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_copy_int
.Nd copy an ACL from external to internal representation
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_copy_int "const void *buf_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_copy_int
function copies an exportable, contiguous, persistent form of an ACL, pointed to by
.Va buf_p ,
to the internal representation.
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)acl_t
returned by
.Fn acl_copy_int
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
Upon success,
the
.Fn acl_copy_int
function returns a pointer that references the ACL in working storage.
On error, a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_copy_int
function returns a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The buffer pointed to by the argument
.Va buf_p
does not contain a valid external form ACL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.
.El
.Sh STANDARDS
IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (\(lqPOSIX.1e\(rq, abandoned)
