.Sh NAME

.Sh LIBRARY

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In acl/libacl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_from_mode "mode_t mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_from_mode
function creates a minimal ACL that contains the three entries with tag
types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER, with permissions
corresponding to the owner, group, and other permission bits of its
argument
.Va mode .
.Sh RETURN VALUE
On success, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage. On error, a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_from_mode
function returns a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the
hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.
.El
.Sh STANDARDS
This is a non-portable, Linux specific extension to the ACL manipulation
functions defined in IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (\(lqPOSIX.1e\(rq, abandoned).
