.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn acl_size "acl_t acl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_size
function return the size, in bytes, of the buffer required to hold the exportable, contiguous, persistent form of the ACL pointed to by the argument
.Va acl ,
when converted by
.Fn acl_copy_ext .
.Pp
Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in
.Va acl
continue to refer to the same entries. Any existing ACL pointers that refer
to the ACL referred to by
.Va acl
continue to refer to the ACL. The order of ACL entries within
.Va acl
remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
On success, the
.Fn acl_size
function returns the size in bytes of the contiguous, persistent form of
the ACL. On error, a value of
.Li (ssize_t)-1
is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_size
function returns a value of
.Li (ssize_t)-1
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
