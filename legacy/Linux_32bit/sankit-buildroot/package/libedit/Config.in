	  The editline library (from BSD) provides generic line editing
	  and history functions. It slightly resembles GNU readline.

	  The official homepage is at:
	  http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-5-0/src/lib/libedit/

	  Jess Thrysoee maintains an autotoolified packaged, which we use
	  in Buildroot as it makes it much simpler than using the upstream
	  sources which require pmake:
