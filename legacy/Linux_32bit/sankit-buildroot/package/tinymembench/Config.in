	  Tinymembench is a simple memory benchmark program, which
	  tries to measure the peak bandwidth of sequential memory
	  accesses and the latency of random memory accesses.
	  Bandwidth is measured by running different assembly code for
	  the aligned memory blocks and attempting different prefetch
	  strategies.
