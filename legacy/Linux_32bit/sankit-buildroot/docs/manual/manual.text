Chapter 1. About Buildroot

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Buildroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of
building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using
cross-compilation.

In order to achieve this, Buildroot is able to generate a
cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image
and a bootloader for your target. Buildroot can be used for any
combination of these options, independently (you can for example use
an existing cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root
filesystem with Buildroot).

Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.

Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
comes with default configurations for several boards available
off-the-shelf. Besides this, a number of third-party projects are
based on, or develop their BSP ^[1] or SDK ^[2] on top of Buildroot.

Chapter 2. Starting up

---------------------------------------------------------------------


2.1. System requirements

--------------

Buildroot is designed to run on Linux systems.

Buildroot needs some software to be already installed on the host
system; here are the lists of the mandatory and optional packages
(package names may vary between distributions).

Take care to install both runtime and development data, especially
for the libraries that may be packaged in 2 distinct packages.

2.1.1. Mandatory packages

  * Build tools:

      o which
      o sed
      o make (version 3.81 or any later)
      o binutils
      o build-essential (only for Debian based systems)
      o gcc (version 2.95 or any later)
      o g++ (version 2.95 or any later)
      o bash
      o patch
      o gzip
      o bzip2
      o perl
      o tar
      o cpio
      o python (version 2.6 or 2.7)
      o unzip
      o rsync
  * Source fetching tools:

      o wget

2.1.2. Optional packages

  * Source fetching tools:

    In the official tree, most of the package sources are retrieved
    using wget; a few are only available through their git,
    mercurial, or svn repository.

    All other source fetching methods are implemented and may be used
    in a development context (further details: refer to Section 6.4,
    “Download infrastructure”).

      o bazaar
      o cvs
      o git
      o mercurial
      o rsync
      o scp
      o subversion
  * Configuration interface dependencies (requires development
    libraries):

      o ncurses5 to use the menuconfig interface
      o qt4 to use the xconfig interface
      o glib2, gtk2 and glade2 to use the gconfig interface
  * Java-related packages, if the Java Classpath needs to be built
    for the target system:

      o The javac compiler
      o The jar tool
  * Documentation generation tools:

      o asciidoc


2.2. Getting Buildroot

--------------

Buildroot releases are made approximately every 3 months. Direct Git
access and daily snapshots are also available, if you want more
bleeding edge.

Releases are available at http://buildroot.net/downloads/.

The latest snapshot is always available at http://buildroot.net/
downloads/snapshots/buildroot-snapshot.tar.bz2, and previous
snapshots are also available at http://buildroot.net/downloads/
snapshots/.

To download Buildroot using Git, you can simply follow the rules
described on the "Accessing Git" page (http://buildroot.net/git.html)
of the Buildroot website (http://buildroot.net). For the impatient,
here’s a quick recipe:

 $ git clone git://git.buildroot.net/buildroot


2.3. Using Buildroot

--------------

Buildroot has a nice configuration tool similar to the one you can
find in the Linux kernel or in Busybox. Note that you can and should
build everything as a normal user. There is no need to be root to
configure and use Buildroot. The first step is to run the
configuration assistant:

 $ make menuconfig

to run the curses-based configurator, or

 $ make xconfig

or

 $ make gconfig

to run the Qt or GTK-based configurators.

All of these "make" commands will need to build a configuration
utility (including the interface), so you may need to install
"development" packages for relevant libraries used by the
configuration utilities. Check Section 2.1, “System requirements” to
know what Buildroot needs, and specifically the optional requirements
Section 2.1.2, “Optional packages” to get the dependencies of your
favorite interface.

For each menu entry in the configuration tool, you can find
associated help that describes the purpose of the entry.

Once everything is configured, the configuration tool generates a
.config file that contains the description of your configuration. It
will be used by the Makefiles to do what’s needed.

Let’s go:

 $ make

You should never use make -jN with Buildroot: it does not support 
top-level parallel make. Instead, use the BR2_JLEVEL option to tell
Buildroot to run each package compilation with make -jN.

The make command will generally perform the following steps:

  * download source files (as required);
  * configure, build and install the cross-compiling toolchain using
    the appropriate toolchain backend, or simply import an external
    toolchain;
  * build/install selected target packages;
  * build a kernel image, if selected;
  * build a bootloader image, if selected;
  * create a root filesystem in selected formats.

Buildroot output is stored in a single directory, output/. This
directory contains several subdirectories:

  * images/ where all the images (kernel image, bootloader and root
    filesystem images) are stored.
  * build/ where all the components except for the cross-compilation
    toolchain are built (this includes tools needed to run Buildroot
    on the host and packages compiled for the target). The build/
    directory contains one subdirectory for each of these components.
  * staging/ which contains a hierarchy similar to a root filesystem
    hierarchy. This directory contains the installation of the
    cross-compilation toolchain and all the userspace packages
    selected for the target. However, this directory is not intended
    to be the root filesystem for the target: it contains a lot of
    development files, unstripped binaries and libraries that make it
    far too big for an embedded system. These development files are
    used to compile libraries and applications for the target that
    depend on other libraries.
  * target/ which contains almost the complete root filesystem for
    the target: everything needed is present except the device files
    in /dev/ (Buildroot can’t create them because Buildroot doesn’t
    run as root and doesn’t want to run as root). Also, it doesn’t
    have the correct permissions (e.g. setuid for the busybox
    binary). Therefore, this directory should not be used on your
    target. Instead, you should use one of the images built in the
    images/ directory. If you need an extracted image of the root
    filesystem for booting over NFS, then use the tarball image
    generated in images/ and extract it as root. Compared to staging
    /, target/ contains only the files and libraries needed to run
    the selected target applications: the development files (headers,
    etc.) are not present, the binaries are stripped.
  * host/ contains the installation of tools compiled for the host
    that are needed for the proper execution of Buildroot, including
    the cross-compilation toolchain.
  * toolchain/ contains the build directories for the various
    components of the cross-compilation toolchain.

These commands, make menuconfig|gconfig|xconfig and make, are the
basic ones that allow to easily and quickly generate images fitting
your needs, with all the supports and applications you enabled.

More details about the "make" command usage are given in Section 3.2,
“make tips”.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 3. Working with Buildroot

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This section explains how you can customize Buildroot to fit your
needs.


3.1. Details on Buildroot configuration

--------------

All the configuration options in make *config have a help text
providing details about the option. However, a number of topics
require additional details that cannot easily be covered in the help
text and are there covered in the following sections.

3.1.1. Cross-compilation toolchain

A compilation toolchain is the set of tools that allows you to
compile code for your system. It consists of a compiler (in our case,
gcc), binary utils like assembler and linker (in our case, binutils)
and a C standard library (for example GNU Libc, uClibc).

The system installed on your development station certainly already
has a compilation toolchain that you can use to compile an
application that runs on your system. If you’re using a PC, your
compilation toolchain runs on an x86 processor and generates code for
an x86 processor. Under most Linux systems, the compilation toolchain
uses the GNU libc (glibc) as the C standard library. This compilation
toolchain is called the "host compilation toolchain". The machine on
which it is running, and on which you’re working, is called the "host
system" ^[3].

The compilation toolchain is provided by your distribution, and
Buildroot has nothing to do with it (other than using it to build a
cross-compilation toolchain and other tools that are run on the
development host).

As said above, the compilation toolchain that comes with your system
runs on and generates code for the processor in your host system. As
your embedded system has a different processor, you need a
cross-compilation toolchain - a compilation toolchain that runs on
your host system but generates code for your target system (and
target processor). For example, if your host system uses x86 and your
target system uses ARM, the regular compilation toolchain on your
host runs on x86 and generates code for x86, while the
cross-compilation toolchain runs on x86 and generates code for ARM.

Buildroot provides different solutions to build, or use existing
cross-compilation toolchains:

  * The internal toolchain backend, called Buildroot toolchain in the
    configuration interface.
  * The external toolchain backend, called External toolchain in the
    configuration interface.
  * The Crosstool-NG toolchain backend, called Crosstool-NG toolchain
    in the configuration interface.

The choice between these three solutions is done using the Toolchain
Type option in the Toolchain menu. Once one solution has been chosen,
a number of configuration options appear, they are detailed in the
following sections.

3.1.1.1. Internal toolchain backend

The internal toolchain backend is the backend where Buildroot builds
by itself a cross-compilation toolchain, before building the
userspace applications and libraries for your target embedded system.

This backend is the historical backend of Buildroot, and has been
limited for a long time to the usage of the uClibc C library. Support
for the eglibc C library has been added in 2013 and is at this point
considered experimental. See the External toolchain backend and 
Crosstool-NG toolchain backend for other solutions to use glibc or 
eglibc.

Once you have selected this backend, a number of options appear. The
most important ones allow to:

  * Change the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build the
    toolchain. This item deserves a few explanations. In the process
    of building a cross-compilation toolchain, the C library is being
    built. This library provides the interface between userspace
    applications and the Linux kernel. In order to know how to "talk"
    to the Linux kernel, the C library needs to have access to the 
    Linux kernel headers (i.e, the .h files from the kernel), which
    define the interface between userspace and the kernel (system
    calls, data structures, etc.). Since this interface is backward
    compatible, the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build
    your toolchain do not need to match exactly the version of the
    Linux kernel you intend to run on your embedded system. They only
    need to have a version equal or older to the version of the Linux
    kernel you intend to run. If you use kernel headers that are more
    recent than the Linux kernel you run on your embedded system,
    then the C library might be using interfaces that are not
    provided by your Linux kernel.
  * Change the version and the configuration of the uClibc C library
    (if uClibc is selected). The default options are usually fine.
    However, if you really need to specifically customize the
    configuration of your uClibc C library, you can pass a specific
    configuration file here. Or alternatively, you can run the make
    uclibc-menuconfig command to get access to uClibc’s configuration
    interface. Note that all packages in Buildroot are tested against
    the default uClibc configuration bundled in Buildroot: if you
    deviate from this configuration by removing features from uClibc,
    some packages may no longer build.
  * Change the version of the GCC compiler and binutils.
  * Select a number of toolchain options (uClibc only): whether the
    toolchain should have largefile support (i.e support for files
    larger than 2 GB on 32 bits systems), IPv6 support, RPC support
    (used mainly for NFS), wide-char support, locale support (for
    internationalization), C++ support, thread support. Depending on
    which options you choose, the number of userspace applications
    and libraries visible in Buildroot menus will change: many
    applications and libraries require certain toolchain options to
    be enabled. Most packages show a comment when a certain toolchain
    option is required to be able to enable those packages.

It is worth noting that whenever one of those options is modified,
then the entire toolchain and system must be rebuilt. See
Section 3.5.1, “Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary”.

Advantages of this backend:

  * Well integrated with Buildroot
  * Fast, only builds what’s necessary

Drawbacks of this backend:

  * Rebuilding the toolchain is needed when doing make clean, which
    takes time. If you’re trying to reduce your build time, consider
    using the External toolchain backend.

3.1.1.2. External toolchain backend

The external toolchain backend allows to use existing pre-built
cross-compilation toolchains. Buildroot knows about a number of
well-known cross-compilation toolchains (from Linaro for ARM,
Sourcery CodeBench for ARM, x86, x86-64, PowerPC, MIPS and SuperH,
Blackfin toolchains from ADI, Xilinx toolchains for Microblaze, etc.)
and is capable of downloading them automatically, or it can be
pointed to a custom toolchain, either available for download or
installed locally.

Then, you have three solutions to use an external toolchain:

  * Use a predefined external toolchain profile, and let Buildroot
    download, extract and install the toolchain. Buildroot already
    knows about a few CodeSourcery, Linaro, Blackfin and Xilinx
    toolchains. Just select the toolchain profile in Toolchain from
    the available ones. This is definitely the easiest solution.
  * Use a predefined external toolchain profile, but instead of
    having Buildroot download and extract the toolchain, you can tell
    Buildroot where your toolchain is already installed on your
    system. Just select the toolchain profile in Toolchain through
    the available ones, unselect Download toolchain automatically,
    and fill the Toolchain path text entry with the path to your
    cross-compiling toolchain.
  * Use a completely custom external toolchain. This is particularly
    useful for toolchains generated using crosstool-NG. To do this,
    select the Custom toolchain solution in the Toolchain list. You
    need to fill the Toolchain path, Toolchain prefix and External
    toolchain C library options. Then, you have to tell Buildroot
    what your external toolchain supports. If your external toolchain
    uses the glibc library, you only have to tell whether your
    toolchain supports C+\+ or not and whether it has built-in RPC
    support. If your external toolchain uses the uClibc library, then
    you have to tell Buildroot if it supports largefile, IPv6, RPC,
    wide-char, locale, program invocation, threads and C++. At the
    beginning of the execution, Buildroot will tell you if the
    selected options do not match the toolchain configuration.

Our external toolchain support has been tested with toolchains from
CodeSourcery and Linaro, toolchains generated by crosstool-NG, and
toolchains generated by Buildroot itself. In general, all toolchains
that support the sysroot feature should work. If not, do not hesitate
to contact the developers.

We do not support toolchains from the ELDK of Denx, for two reasons:

  * The ELDK does not contain a pure toolchain (i.e just the
    compiler, binutils, the C and C++ libraries), but a toolchain
    that comes with a very large set of pre-compiled libraries and
    programs. Therefore, Buildroot cannot import the sysroot of the
    toolchain, as it would contain hundreds of megabytes of
    pre-compiled libraries that are normally built by Buildroot.
  * The ELDK toolchains have a completely non-standard custom
    mechanism to handle multiple library variants. Instead of using
    the standard GCC multilib mechanism, the ARM ELDK uses different
    symbolic links to the compiler to differentiate between library
    variants (for ARM soft-float and ARM VFP), and the PowerPC ELDK
    compiler uses a CROSS_COMPILE environment variable. This
    non-standard behaviour makes it difficult to support ELDK in
    Buildroot.

We also do not support using the distribution toolchain (i.e the gcc/
binutils/C library installed by your distribution) as the toolchain
to build software for the target. This is because your distribution
toolchain is not a "pure" toolchain (i.e only with the C/C++
library), so we cannot import it properly into the Buildroot build
environment. So even if you are building a system for a x86 or x86_64
target, you have to generate a cross-compilation toolchain with
Buildroot or crosstool-NG.

If you want to generate a custom toolchain for your project, that can
be used as an external toolchain in Buildroot, our recommandation is
definitely to build it with crosstool-NG. We recommend to build the
toolchain separately from Buildroot, and then import it in Buildroot
using the external toolchain backend.

Advantages of this backend:

  * Allows to use well-known and well-tested cross-compilation
    toolchains.
  * Avoids the build time of the cross-compilation toolchain, which
    is often very significant in the overall build time of an
    embedded Linux system.
  * Not limited to uClibc: glibc and eglibc toolchains are supported.

Drawbacks of this backend:

  * If your pre-built external toolchain has a bug, may be hard to
    get a fix from the toolchain vendor, unless you build your
    external toolchain by yourself using Crosstool-NG.

3.1.1.3. Crosstool-NG toolchain backend

The Crosstool-NG toolchain backend integrates the Crosstool-NG
project with Buildroot. Crosstool-NG is a highly-configurable,
versatile and well-maintained tool to build cross-compilation
toolchains.

If you select the Crosstool-NG toolchain option in Toolchain Type,
then you will be offered to:

  * Choose which C library you want to use. Crosstool-NG supports the
    three most important C libraries used in Linux systems: glibc,
    eglibc and uClibc
  * Choose a custom Crosstool-NG configuration file. Buildroot has
    its own default configuration file (one per C library choice),
    but you can provide your own. Another option is to run make
    ctng-menuconfig to get access to the Crosstool-NG configuration
    interface. However, note that all Buildroot packages have only
    been tested with the default Crosstool-NG configurations.
  * Choose a number of toolchain options (rather limited if glibc or
    eglibc are used, or numerous if uClibc is used)

When you will start the Buildroot build process, Buildroot will
download and install the Crosstool-NG tool, build and install its
required dependencies, and then run Crosstool-NG with the provided
configuration.

Advantages of this backend:

  * Not limited to uClibc: glibc and eglibc are supported.
  * Vast possibilities of toolchain configuration.

Drawbacks of this backend:

  * Crosstool-NG is not perfectly integrated with Buildroot. For
    example, Crosstool-NG has its own download infrastructure, not
    integrated with the one in Buildroot (for example a Buildroot
    make source will not download all the source code tarballs needed
    by Crosstool-NG).
  * The toolchain is completely rebuilt from scratch if you do a make
    clean.

3.1.2. /dev management

On a Linux system, the /dev directory contains special files, called 
device files, that allow userspace applications to access the
hardware devices managed by the Linux kernel. Without these device
files, your userspace applications would not be able to use the
hardware devices, even if they are properly recognized by the Linux
kernel.

Under System configuration, /dev management, Buildroot offers four
different solutions to handle the /dev directory :

  * The first solution is Static using device table. This is the old
    classical way of handling device files in Linux. With this
    method, the device files are persistently stored in the root
    filesystem (i.e they persist accross reboots), and there is
    nothing that will automatically create and remove those device
    files when hardware devices are added or removed from the system.
    Buildroot therefore creates a standard set of device files using
    a device table, the default one being stored in system/
    device_table_dev.txt in the Buildroot source code. This file is
    processed when Buildroot generates the final root filesystem
    image, and the device files are therefore not visible in the
    output/target directory. The BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE
    option allows to change the default device table used by
    Buildroot, or to add an additional device table, so that
    additional device files are created by Buildroot during the
    build. So, if you use this method, and a device file is missing
    in your system, you can for example create a board/<yourcompany>/
    <yourproject>/device_table_dev.txt file that contains the
    description of your additional device files, and then you can set
    BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE to system/device_table_dev.txt
    board/<yourcompany>/<yourproject>/device_table_dev.txt. For more
    details about the format of the device table file, see
    Section 11.1, “Makedev syntax documentation”.
  * The second solution is Dynamic using devtmpfs only. devtmpfs is a
    virtual filesystem inside the Linux kernel that has been
    introduced in kernel 2.6.32 (if you use an older kernel, it is
    not possible to use this option). When mounted in /dev, this
    virtual filesystem will automatically make device files appear
    and disappear as hardware devices are added and removed from the
    system. This filesystem is not persistent accross reboots: it is
    filled dynamically by the kernel. Using devtmpfs requires the
    following kernel configuration options to be enabled:
    CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT. When Buildroot is in
    charge of building the Linux kernel for your embedded device, it
    makes sure that those two options are enabled. However, if you
    build your Linux kernel outside of Buildroot, then it is your
    responsability to enable those two options (if you fail to do so,
    your Buildroot system will not boot).
  * The third solution is Dynamic using mdev. This method also relies
    on the devtmpfs virtual filesystem detailed above (so the
    requirement to have CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
    enabled in the kernel configuration still apply), but adds the
    mdev userspace utility on top of it. mdev is a program part of
    Busybox that the kernel will call every time a device is added or
    removed. Thanks to the /etc/mdev.conf configuration file, mdev
    can be configured to for example, set specific permissions or
    ownership on a device file, call a script or application whenever
    a device appears or disappear, etc. Basically, it allows 
    userspace to react on device addition and removal events. mdev
    can for example be used to automatically load kernel modules when
    devices appear on the system. mdev is also important if you have
    devices that require a firmware, as it will be responsible for
    pushing the firmware contents to the kernel. mdev is a
    lightweight implementation (with fewer features) of udev. For
    more details about mdev and the syntax of its configuration file,
    see http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/docs/mdev.txt.
  * The fourth solution is Dynamic using udev. This method also
    relies on the devtmpfs virtual filesystem detailed above, but
    adds the udev userspace daemon on top of it. udev is a daemon
    that runs in the background, and gets called by the kernel when a
    device gets added or removed from the system. It is a more
    heavyweight solution than mdev, but provides higher flexibility
    and is sometimes mandatory for some system components (systemd
    for example). udev is the mechanism used in most desktop Linux
    distributions. For more details about udev, see http://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev.

The Buildroot developers recommandation is to start with the Dynamic
using devtmpfs only solution, until you have the need for userspace
to be notified when devices are added/removed, or if firmwares are
needed, in which case Dynamic using mdev is usually a good solution.

3.1.3. init system

The init program is the first userspace program started by the kernel
(it carries the PID number 1), and is responsible for starting the
userspace services and programs (for example: web server, graphical
applications, other network servers, etc.).

Buildroot allows to use three different types of init systems, which
can be chosen from System configuration, Init system:

  * The first solution is Busybox. Amongst many programs, Busybox has
    an implementation of a basic init program, which is sufficient
    for most embedded systems. Enabling the BR2_INIT_BUSYBOX will
    ensure Busybox will build and install its init program. This is
    the default solution in Buildroot. The Busybox init program will
    read the /etc/inittab file at boot to know what to do. The syntax
    of this file can be found in http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/
    examples/inittab (note that Busybox inittab syntax is special: do
    not use a random inittab documentation from the Internet to learn
    about Busybox inittab). The default inittab in Buildroot is
    stored in system/skeleton/etc/inittab. Apart from mounting a few
    important filesystems, the main job the default inittab does is
    to start the /etc/init.d/rcS shell script, and start a getty
    program (which provides a login prompt).
  * The second solution is systemV. This solution uses the old
    traditional sysvinit program, packed in Buildroot in package/
    sysvinit. This was the solution used in most desktop Linux
    distributions, until they switched to more recent alternatives
    such as Upstart or Systemd. sysvinit also works with an inittab
    file (which has a slightly different syntax than the one from
    Busybox). The default inittab installed with this init solution
    is located in package/sysvinit/inittab.
  * The third solution is systemd. systemd is the new generation init
    system for Linux. It does far more than traditional init
    programs: aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket
    and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand
    starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control
    groups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
    etc. systemd will be useful on relatively complex embedded
    systems, for example the ones requiring D-Bus and services
    communicating between each other. It is worth noting that systemd
    brings a fairly big number of large dependencies: dbus, glib and
    more. For more details about systemd, see http://
    www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd.

The solution recommended by Buildroot developers is to use the 
Busybox init as it is sufficient for most embedded systems. systemd
can be used for more complex situations.


3.2. make tips

--------------

This is a collection of tips that help you make the most of
Buildroot.

Configuration searches: The make *config commands offer a search
tool. Read the help message in the different frontend menus to know
how to use it:

  * in menuconfig, the search tool is called by pressing /;
  * in xconfig, the search tool is called by pressing Ctrl + f.

The result of the search shows the help message of the matching
items.

Display all commands executed by make: 

 $ make V=1 <target>

Display all available targets: 

 $ make help

Not all targets are always available, some settings in the .config
file may hide some targets:

  * linux-menuconfig and linux-savedefconfig only work when linux is
    enabled;
  * uclibc-menuconfig is only available when the Buildroot internal
    toolchain backend is used;
  * ctng-menuconfig is only available when the crosstool-NG backend
    is used;
  * barebox-menuconfig and barebox-savedefconfig only work when the
    barebox bootloader is enabled.

Cleaning: Explicit cleaning is required when any of the architecture
or toolchain configuration options are changed.

To delete all build products (including build directories, host,
staging and target trees, the images and the toolchain):

 $ make clean

Generating the manual: The present manual sources are located in the 
docs/manual directory. To generate the manual:

 $ make manual-clean
 $ make manual

The manual outputs will be generated in output/docs/manual.

Notes

  * asciidoc is required to build the documentation (see:
    Section 2.1.2, “Optional packages”).
  * There is a known issue that you can’t build it under Debian
    Squeeze.

Reseting Buildroot for a new target: To delete all build products as
well as the configuration:

 $ make distclean

Notes. If ccache is enabled, running make clean or distclean does not
empty the compiler cache used by Buildroot. To delete it, refer to
Section 5.2.2, “Using ccache in Buildroot”.


3.3. Customization

--------------

3.3.1. Customizing the generated target filesystem

Besides changing one or another configuration through make *config,
there are a few ways to customize the resulting target filesystem.

  * Customize the target filesystem directly and rebuild the image.
    The target filesystem is available under output/target/. You can
    simply make your changes here and run make afterwards - this will
    rebuild the target filesystem image. This method allows you to do
    anything to the target filesystem, but if you decide to
    completely rebuild your toolchain and tools, these changes will
    be lost. This solution is therefore only useful for quick tests
    only: changes do not survive the make clean command. Once you
    have validated your changes, you should make sure that they will
    persist after a make clean by using one of the following methods.
  * Create a filesystem overlay: a tree of files that are copied
    directly over the target filesystem after it has been built. Set
    BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY to the top of the tree. .git, .svn, .hg
    directories, .empty files and files ending with ~ are excluded. 
    Among these first 3 methods, this one should be preferred.
  * In the Buildroot configuration, you can specify the paths to one
    or more post-build scripts. These scripts are called in the given
    order, after Buildroot builds all the selected software, but 
    before the rootfs images are assembled. The
    BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT allows you to specify the location
    of your post-build scripts. This option can be found in the
    System configuration menu. The destination root filesystem folder
    is given as the first argument to these scripts, and these
    scripts can then be used to remove or modify any file in your
    target filesystem. You should, however, use this feature with
    care. Whenever you find that a certain package generates wrong or
    unneeded files, you should fix that package rather than work
    around it with some post-build cleanup scripts. You may also use
    these variables in your post-build script:

      o BUILDROOT_CONFIG: the path to the Buildroot .config file
      o HOST_DIR, STAGING_DIR, TARGET_DIR: see Section 6.2.4.2,
        “generic-package Reference”
      o BINARIES_DIR: the place where all binary files (aka images)
        are stored
      o BASE_DIR: the base output directory
  * Create your own target skeleton. You can start with the default
    skeleton available under system/skeleton and then customize it to
    suit your needs. The BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM and
    BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM_PATH will allow you to specify the
    location of your custom skeleton. These options can be found in
    the System configuration menu. At build time, the contents of the
    skeleton are copied to output/target before any package
    installation. Note that this method is not recommended, as it
    duplicates the entire skeleton, which prevents from taking
    advantage of the fixes or improvements brought to the default
    Buildroot skeleton. The recommended method is to use the 
    post-build scripts mechanism described in the previous item.

Note also that you can use the post-image scripts if you want to
perform some specific actions after all filesystem images have been
created (for example to automatically extract your root filesystem
tarball in a location exported by your NFS server, or to create a
special firmware image that bundles your root filesystem and kernel
image, or any other custom action), you can specify a space-separated
list of scripts in the BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT configuration
option. This option can be found in the System configuration menu as
well.

Each of those scripts will be called with the path to the images
output directory as first argument, and will be executed with the
main Buildroot source directory as the current directory. Those
scripts will be executed as the user that executes Buildroot, which
should normally not be the root user. Therefore, any action requiring
root permissions in one of these post-image scripts will require
special handling (usage of fakeroot or sudo), which is left to the
script developer.

Just like for the post-build scripts mentioned above, you also have
access to the following environment variables from your post-image
scripts: BUILDROOT_CONFIG, HOST_DIR, STAGING_DIR, TARGET_DIR,
BINARIES_DIR and BASE_DIR.

Additionally, each of the BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT and
BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT scripts will be passed the arguments
specified in BR2_ROOTFS_POST_SCRIPT_ARGS (if that is not empty). All
the scripts will be passed the exact same set of arguments, it is not
possible to pass different sets of arguments to each script.

3.3.2. Customizing the Busybox configuration

Busybox is very configurable, and you may want to customize it. You
can follow these simple steps to do so. This method isn’t optimal,
but it’s simple, and it works:

  * Do an initial compilation of Buildroot, with busybox, without
    trying to customize it.
  * Invoke make busybox-menuconfig. The nice configuration tool
    appears, and you can customize everything.
  * Run the compilation of Buildroot again.

Otherwise, you can simply change the package/busybox/busybox-
<version>.config file, if you know the options you want to change,
without using the configuration tool.

If you want to use an existing config file for busybox, then see
Section 3.5.5, “Environment variables”.

3.3.3. Customizing the uClibc configuration

Just like BusyBox Section 3.3.2, “Customizing the Busybox
configuration”, uClibc offers a lot of configuration options. They
allow you to select various functionalities depending on your needs
and limitations.

The easiest way to modify the configuration of uClibc is to follow
these steps:

  * Do an initial compilation of Buildroot without trying to
    customize uClibc.
  * Invoke make uclibc-menuconfig. The nice configuration assistant,
    similar to the one used in the Linux kernel or Buildroot,
    appears. Make your configuration changes as appropriate.
  * Copy the $(O)/build/uClibc-VERSION/.config file to a different
    place (e.g. board/MANUFACTURER/BOARDNAME/uClibc.config) and
    adjust the uClibc configuration file option BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG to
    refer to this configuration instead of the default one.
  * Run the compilation of Buildroot again.

Otherwise, you can simply change package/uclibc/
uClibc-VERSION.config, without running the configuration assistant.

If you want to use an existing config file for uClibc, then see
Section 3.5.5, “Environment variables”.

3.3.4. Customizing the Linux kernel configuration

The Linux kernel configuration can be customized just like BusyBox
Section 3.3.2, “Customizing the Busybox configuration” and uClibc
Section 3.3.3, “Customizing the uClibc configuration” using make
linux-menuconfig. Make sure you have enabled the kernel build in make
menuconfig first. Once done, run make to (re)build everything.

If you want to use an existing config file for Linux, then see
Section 3.5.5, “Environment variables”.

3.3.5. Customizing the toolchain

There are three distinct types of toolchain backend supported in
Buildroot, available under the menu Toolchain, invoking make
menuconfig.

3.3.5.1. Using the external toolchain backend

There is no way of tuning an external toolchain since Buildroot does
not generate it.

It also requires to set the Buildroot settings according to the
toolchain ones (see Section 3.1.1.2, “External toolchain backend”).

3.3.5.2. Using the internal Buildroot toolchain backend

The internal Buildroot toolchain backend only allows to generate 
uClibc-based toolchains.

However, it allows to tune major settings, such as:

  * Linux headers version;
  * uClibc configuration (see uClibc Section 3.3.3, “Customizing the
    uClibc configuration”);
  * Binutils, GCC, Gdb and toolchain options.

These settings are available after selecting the Buildroot toolchain
type in the menu Toolchain.

3.3.5.3. Using the Crosstool-NG backend

The crosstool-NG toolchain backend enables a rather limited set of
settings under the Buildroot Toolchain menu:

  * The crosstool-NG configuration file
  * Gdb and some toolchain options

Then, the toolchain can be fine-tuned by invoking make
ctng-menuconfig.


3.4. Storing the configuration

--------------

When you have a buildroot configuration that you are satisfied with
and you want to share it with others, put it under revision control
or move on to a different buildroot project, you need to store the
configuration so it can be rebuilt later. The configuration that
needs to be stored consists of the buildroot configuration, the
configuration files for packages that you use (kernel, busybox,
uClibc, …), and your rootfs modifications.

3.4.1. Basics for storing the configuration

3.4.1.1. Buildroot configuration

For storing the buildroot configuration itself, buildroot offers the
following command: make savedefconfig.

This strips the buildroot configuration down by removing
configuration options that are at their default value. The result is
stored in a file called defconfig. If you want to save it in another
place, change the BR2_DEFCONFIG option, or call make with make
savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=<path-to-defconfig>. The usual place is
configs/<boardname>_defconfig. The configuration can then be rebuilt
by running make <boardname>_defconfig.

Alternatively, you can copy the file to any other place and rebuild
with make defconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=<path-to-defconfig-file>.

3.4.1.2. Other package configuration

The configuration files for busybox, the linux kernel, barebox,
uClibc and crosstool-NG should be stored as well if changed. For each
of these, a buildroot configuration option exists to point to an
input configuration file, e.g. BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.
To save their configuration, set those configuration options to a
path outside your output directory, e.g. board/<manufacturer>/
<boardname>/linux.config. Then, copy the configuration files to that
path.

Make sure that you create a configuration file before changing the
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE etc. options. Otherwise,
buildroot will try to access this config file, which doesn’t exist
yet, and will fail. You can create the configuration file by running
make linux-menuconfig etc.

Buildroot provides a few helper targets to make the saving of
configuration files easier.

  * make linux-update-defconfig saves the linux configuration to the
    path specified by BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE. It
    simplifies the config file by removing default values. However,
    this only works with kernels starting from 2.6.33. For earlier
    kernels, use make linux-update-config.
  * make busybox-update-config saves the busybox configuration to the
    path specified by BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG.
  * make uclibc-update-config saves the uClibc configuration to the
    path specified by BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG.
  * make barebox-update-defconfig saves the barebox configuration to
    the path specified by BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.
  * For crosstool-NG and at91bootstrap3, no helper exists so you have
    to copy the config file manually to BR2_TOOLCHAIN_CTNG_CONFIG,
    resp. BR2_TARGET_AT91BOOTSTRAP3_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.

3.4.2. Creating your own board support

Creating your own board support in Buildroot allows users of a
particular hardware platform to easily build a system that is known
to work.

To do so, you need to create a normal Buildroot configuration that
builds a basic system for the hardware: toolchain, kernel,
bootloader, filesystem and a simple Busybox-only userspace. No
specific package should be selected: the configuration should be as
minimal as possible, and should only build a working basic Busybox
system for the target platform. You can of course use more
complicated configurations for your internal projects, but the
Buildroot project will only integrate basic board configurations.
This is because package selections are highly application-specific.

Once you have a known working configuration, run make savedefconfig.
This will generate a minimal defconfig file at the root of the
Buildroot source tree. Move this file into the configs/ directory,
and rename it <boardname>_defconfig.

It is recommended to use as much as possible upstream versions of the
Linux kernel and bootloaders, and to use as much as possible default
kernel and bootloader configurations. If they are incorrect for your
board, or no default exists, we encourage you to send fixes to the
corresponding upstream projects.

However, in the mean time, you may want to store kernel or bootloader
configuration or patches specific to your target platform. To do so,
create a directory board/<manufacturer> and a subdirectory board/
<manufacturer>/<boardname>. You can then store your patches and
configurations in these directories, and reference them from the main
Buildroot configuration.

3.4.3. Step-by-step instructions for storing configuration

To store the configuration for a specific product, device or
application, it is advisable to use the same conventions as for the
board support: put the buildroot defconfig in the configs directory,
and any other files in a subdirectory of the boards directory. This
section gives step-by-step instructions about how to do that. Of
course, you can skip the steps that are not relevant for your use
case.

 1. make menuconfig to configure toolchain, packages and kernel.
 2. make linux-menuconfig to update the kernel config, similar for
    other configuration.
 3. mkdir -p board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>
 4. Set the following options to board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
    <package>.config (as far as they are relevant):

      * BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
      * BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG
      * BR2_TOOLCHAIN_CTNG_CONFIG
      * BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG
      * BR2_TARGET_AT91BOOTSTRAP3_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
      * BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
 5. Write the configuration files:

      * make linux-update-defconfig
      * make busybox-update-config
      * cp <output>/build/build-toolchain/.config board/
        <manufacturer>/<boardname>/ctng.config
      * make uclibc-update-config
      * cp <output>/build/at91bootstrap3-*/.config board/
        <manufacturer>/<boardname>/at91bootstrap3.config
      * make barebox-update-defconfig
 6. Create board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/fs-overlay/ and fill it
    with additional files you need on your rootfs, e.g. board/
    <manufacturer>/<boardname>/fs-overlay/etc/inittab. Set
    BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY to board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
    fs-overlay.
 7. Create a post-build script board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
    post-build.sh. Set BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT to board/
    <manufacturer>/<boardname>/post-build.sh
 8. If additional setuid permissions have to be set or device nodes
    have to be created, create board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
    device_table.txt and add that path to BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE.
 9. make savedefconfig to save the buildroot configuration.
10. cp defconfig configs/<boardname>_defconfig
11. To add patches to the linux build, set BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH to
    board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/patches/linux/ and add your
    patches in that directory. Each patch should be called linux-
    <num>-<description>.patch. Similar for U-Boot, barebox,
    at91bootstrap and at91bootstrap3.
12. If you need modifications to other packages, or if you need to
    add packages, do that directly in the packages/ directory,
    following the instructions in Section 6.2, “Adding new packages
    to Buildroot”.

3.4.4. Customizing packages

It is sometimes useful to apply extra patches to packages - over and
above those provided in Buildroot. This might be used to support
custom features in a project, for example, or when working on a new
architecture.

The BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR configuration file option can be used to
specify a directory containing global package patches.

For a specific version <packageversion> of a specific package
<packagename>, patches are applied as follows.

First, the default Buildroot patch set for the package is applied.

If the directory $(BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR)/<packagename>/
<packageversion> exists, then all *.patch files in the directory will
be applied.

Otherwise, if the directory $(BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR)/<packagename>
exists, then all *.patch files in the directory will be applied.


3.5. Daily use

--------------

3.5.1. Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary

A full rebuild is achieved by running:

$ make clean all

In some cases, a full rebuild is mandatory:

  * each time the toolchain properties are changed, this includes:

      o after changing any toolchain option under the Toolchain menu
        (if the internal Buildroot backend is used);
      o after running make ctng-menuconfig (if the crosstool-NG
        backend is used);
      o after running make uclibc-menuconfig.
  * after removing some libraries from the package selection.

In some cases, a full rebuild is recommended:

  * after adding some libraries to the package selection (otherwise,
    packages that can be optionally linked against those libraries
    won’t be rebuilt, so they won’t support those new available
    features).

In other cases, it is up to you to decide if you should run a full
rebuild, but you should know what is impacted and understand what you
are doing anyway.

3.5.2. Understanding how to rebuild packages

One of the most common questions asked by Buildroot users is how to
rebuild a given package or how to remove a package without rebuilding
everything from scratch.

Removing a package is unsupported by Buildroot without rebuilding
from scratch. This is because Buildroot doesn’t keep track of which
package installs what files in the output/staging and output/target
directories, or which package would be compiled differently depending
on the availability of another package.

The easiest way to rebuild a single package from scratch is to remove
its build directory in output/build. Buildroot will then re-extract,
re-configure, re-compile and re-install this package from scratch.
You can ask buildroot to do this with the make <package>-dirclean
command.

For convenience, the special make targets <package>-reconfigure and
<package>-rebuild repeat the configure resp. build steps.

However, if you don’t want to rebuild the package completely from
scratch, a better understanding of the Buildroot internals is needed.
Internally, to keep track of which steps have been done and which
steps remain to be done, Buildroot maintains stamp files (empty files
that just tell whether this or that action has been done):

  * output/build/<package>-<version>/.stamp_configured. If removed,
    Buildroot will trigger the recompilation of the package from the
    configuration step (execution of ./configure).
  * output/build/<package>-<version>/.stamp_built. If removed,
    Buildroot will trigger the recompilation of the package from the
    compilation step (execution of make).

Note: toolchain packages use custom makefiles. Their stamp files are
named differently.

Further details about package special make targets are explained in
Section 5.2.4, “Package-specific make targets”.

3.5.3. Offline builds

If you intend to do an offline build and just want to download all
sources that you previously selected in the configurator (menuconfig,
xconfig or gconfig), then issue:

 $ make source

You can now disconnect or copy the content of your dl directory to
the build-host.

3.5.4. Building out-of-tree

As default, everything built by Buildroot is stored in the directory
output in the Buildroot tree.

Buildroot also supports building out of tree with a syntax similar to
the Linux kernel. To use it, add O=<directory> to the make command
line:

 $ make O=/tmp/build

Or:

 $ cd /tmp/build; make O=$PWD -C path/to/buildroot

All the output files will be located under /tmp/build.

When using out-of-tree builds, the Buildroot .config and temporary
files are also stored in the output directory. This means that you
can safely run multiple builds in parallel using the same source tree
as long as they use unique output directories.

For ease of use, Buildroot generates a Makefile wrapper in the output
directory - so after the first run, you no longer need to pass O=..
and -C .., simply run (in the output directory):

 $ make <target>

3.5.5. Environment variables

Buildroot also honors some environment variables, when they are
passed to make or set in the environment:

  * HOSTCXX, the host C++ compiler to use
  * HOSTCC, the host C compiler to use
  * UCLIBC_CONFIG_FILE=<path/to/.config>, path to the uClibc
    configuration file, used to compile uClibc, if an internal
    toolchain is being built. Note that the uClibc configuration file
    can also be set from the configuration interface, so through the
    Buildroot .config file; this is the recommended way of setting
    it.
  * BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FILE=<path/to/.config>, path to the Busybox
    configuration file. Note that the Busybox configuration file can
    also be set from the configuration interface, so through the
    Buildroot .config file; this is the recommended way of setting
    it.
  * BUILDROOT_DL_DIR to override the directory in which Buildroot
    stores/retrieves downloaded files Note that the Buildroot
    download directory can also be set from the configuration
    interface, so through the Buildroot .config file; this is the
    recommended way of setting it.

An example that uses config files located in the toplevel directory
and in your $HOME:

 $ make UCLIBC_CONFIG_FILE=uClibc.config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/bb.config

If you want to use a compiler other than the default gcc or g++ for
building helper-binaries on your host, then do

 $ make HOSTCXX=g++-4.3-HEAD HOSTCC=gcc-4.3-HEAD


3.6. Integration with Eclipse

--------------

While a part of the embedded Linux developers like classical text
editors like Vim or Emacs, and command-line based interfaces, a
number of other embedded Linux developers like richer graphical
interfaces to do their development work. Eclipse being one of the
most popular Integrated Development Environment, Buildroot integrates
with Eclipse in order to ease the development work of Eclipse users.

Our integration with Eclipse simplifies the compilation, remote
execution and remote debugging of applications and libraries that are
built on top of a Buildroot system. It does not integrate the
Buildroot configuration and build processes themselves with Eclipse.
Therefore, the typical usage model of our Eclipse integration would
be:

  * Configure your Buildroot system with make menuconfig, make
    xconfig or any other configuration interface provided with
    Buildroot.
  * Build your Buildroot system by running make.
  * Start Eclipse to develop, execute and debug your own custom
    applications and libraries, that will rely on the libraries built
    and installed by Buildroot.

The Buildroot Eclipse integration installation process and usage is
described in detail at https://github.com/mbats/
eclipse-buildroot-bundle/wiki.


3.7. Hacking Buildroot

--------------

If Buildroot does not yet fit all your requirements, you may be
interested in hacking it to add:

  * new packages: refer to the Developer guide Section 6.2, “Adding
    new packages to Buildroot”
  * new board support: refer to the Developer guide Section 3.4.2,
    “Creating your own board support”.


--------------

^[3] This terminology differs from what is used by GNU configure,
where the host is the machine on which the application will run
(which is usually the same as target)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4. Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting

---------------------------------------------------------------------


4.1. The boot hangs after Starting network…

--------------

If the boot process seems to hang after the following messages
(messages not necessarily exactly similar, depending on the list of
packages selected):

Freeing init memory: 3972K
Initializing random number generator... done.
Starting network...
Starting dropbear sshd: generating rsa key... generating dsa key... OK

then it means that your system is running, but didn’t start a shell
on the serial console. In order to have the system start a shell on
your serial console, you have to go into the Buildroot configuration,
System configuration, and modify Port to run a getty (login prompt)
on and Baudrate to use as appropriate. This will automatically tune
the /etc/inittab file of the generated system so that a shell starts
on the correct serial port.


4.2. module-init-tools fails to build with cannot find -lc

--------------

If the build of module-init-tools for the host fails with:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc

then probably you are running a Fedora (or similar) distribution, and
you should install the glibc-static package. This is because the
module-init-tools build process wants to link statically against the
C library.


4.3. Why is there no compiler on the target?

--------------

It has been decided that support for the native compiler on the
target would be stopped from the Buildroot-2012.11 release because:

  * this feature was neither maintained nor tested, and often broken;
  * this feature was only available for Buildroot toolchains;
  * Buildroot mostly targets small or very small target hardware with
    limited resource onboard (CPU, ram, mass-storage), for which
    compiling does not make much sense.

If you need a compiler on your target anyway, then Buildroot is not
suitable for your purpose. In such case, you need a real distribution
and you should opt for something like:

  * openembedded
  * yocto
  * emdebian
  * Fedora
  * openSUSE ARM
  * Arch Linux ARM
  * …


4.4. Why are there no development files on the target?

--------------

Since there is no compiler available on the target (see Section 4.3,
“Why is there no compiler on the target?”), it does not make sense to
waste space with headers or static libraries.

Therefore, those files are always removed from the target since the
Buildroot-2012.11 release.


4.5. Why is there no documentation on the target?

--------------

Because Buildroot mostly targets small or very small target hardware
with limited resource onboard (CPU, ram, mass-storage), it does not
make sense to waste space with the documentation data.

If you need documentation data on your target anyway, then Buildroot
is not suitable for your purpose, and you should look for a real
distribution (see: Section 4.3, “Why is there no compiler on the
target?”).


4.6. Why are some packages not visible in the Buildroot config menu?

--------------

If a package exists in the Buildroot tree and does not appear in the
config menu, this most likely means that some of the package’s
dependencies are not met.

To know more about the dependencies of a package, search for the
package symbol in the config menu (see Section 3.2, “make tips”).

Then, you may have to recursively enable several options (which
correspond to the unmet dependencies) to finally be able to select
the package.

If the package is not visible due to some unmet toolchain options,
then you should certainly run a full rebuild (see Section 3.2, “make
tips” for more explanations).


4.7. Why not use the target directory as a chroot directory?

--------------

There are plenty of reasons to not use the target directory a chroot
one, among these:

  * file ownerships, modes and permissions are not correctly set in
    the target directory;
  * device nodes are not created in the target directory.

For these reasons, commands run through chroot, using the target
directory as the new root, will most likely fail.

If you want to run the target filesystem inside a chroot, or as an
NFS root, then use the tarball image generated in images/ and extract
it as root.

Chapter 5. Going further in Buildroot’s innards

---------------------------------------------------------------------


5.1. How Buildroot works

--------------

As mentioned above, Buildroot is basically a set of Makefiles that
download, configure, and compile software with the correct options.
It also includes patches for various software packages - mainly the
ones involved in the cross-compilation toolchain (gcc, binutils and
uClibc).

There is basically one Makefile per software package, and they are
named with the .mk extension. Makefiles are split into many different
parts.

  * The toolchain/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated
    files for all software related to the cross-compilation
    toolchain: binutils, gcc, gdb, kernel-headers and uClibc.
  * The arch/ directory contains the definitions for all the
    processor architectures that are supported by Buildroot.
  * The package/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated
    files for all user-space tools and libraries that Buildroot can
    compile and add to the target root filesystem. There is one
    sub-directory per package.
  * The linux/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files
    for the Linux kernel.
  * The boot/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files
    for the bootloaders supported by Buildroot.
  * The system/ directory contains support for system integration,
    e.g. the target filesystem skeleton and the selection of an init
    system.
  * The fs/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files for
    software related to the generation of the target root filesystem
    image.

Each directory contains at least 2 files:

  * something.mk is the Makefile that downloads, configures, compiles
    and installs the package something.
  * Config.in is a part of the configuration tool description file.
    It describes the options related to the package.

The main Makefile performs the following steps (once the
configuration is done):

  * Create all the output directories: staging, target, build,
    stamps, etc. in the output directory (output/ by default, another
    value can be specified using O=)
  * Generate all the targets listed in the BASE_TARGETS variable.
    When an internal toolchain is used, this means generating the
    cross-compilation toolchain. When an external toolchain is used,
    this means checking the features of the external toolchain and
    importing it into the Buildroot environment.
  * Generate all the targets listed in the TARGETS variable. This
    variable is filled by all the individual components' Makefiles.
    Generating these targets will trigger the compilation of the
    userspace packages (libraries, programs), the kernel, the
    bootloader and the generation of the root filesystem images,
    depending on the configuration.


5.2. Advanced usage

--------------

5.2.1. Using the generated toolchain outside Buildroot

You may want to compile, for your target, your own programs or other
software that are not packaged in Buildroot. In order to do this you
can use the toolchain that was generated by Buildroot.

The toolchain generated by Buildroot is located by default in output/
host/. The simplest way to use it is to add output/host/usr/bin/ to
your PATH environment variable and then to use ARCH-linux-gcc,
ARCH-linux-objdump, ARCH-linux-ld, etc.

It is possible to relocate the toolchain - but then --sysroot must be
passed every time the compiler is called to tell where the libraries
and header files are.

It is also possible to generate the Buildroot toolchain in a
directory other than output/host by using the Build options → Host
dir option. This could be useful if the toolchain must be shared with
other users.

5.2.2. Using ccache in Buildroot

ccache is a compiler cache. It stores the object files resulting from
each compilation process, and is able to skip future compilation of
the same source file (with same compiler and same arguments) by using
the pre-existing object files. When doing almost identical builds
from scratch a number of times, it can nicely speed up the build
process.

ccache support is integrated in Buildroot. You just have to enable
Enable compiler cache in Build options. This will automatically build
ccache and use it for every host and target compilation.

The cache is located in $HOME/.buildroot-ccache. It is stored outside
of Buildroot output directory so that it can be shared by separate
Buildroot builds. If you want to get rid of the cache, simply remove
this directory.

You can get statistics on the cache (its size, number of hits,
misses, etc.) by running make ccache-stats.

5.2.3. Location of downloaded packages

The various tarballs that are downloaded by Buildroot are all stored
in BR2_DL_DIR, which by default is the dl directory. If you want to
keep a complete version of Buildroot which is known to be working
with the associated tarballs, you can make a copy of this directory.
This will allow you to regenerate the toolchain and the target
filesystem with exactly the same versions.

If you maintain several Buildroot trees, it might be better to have a
shared download location. This can be achieved by pointing the
BUILDROOT_DL_DIR environment variable to a directory. If this is set,
then the value of BR2_DL_DIR in the Buildroot configuration is
overridden. The following line should be added to <~/.bashrc>.

 $ export BUILDROOT_DL_DIR <shared download location>

The download location can also be set in the .config file, with the
BR2_DL_DIR option. This value is overridden by the BUILDROOT_DL_DIR
environment variable.

5.2.4. Package-specific make targets

Running make <package> builds and installs that particular package
and its dependencies.

For packages relying on the Buildroot infrastructure, there are
numerous special make targets that can be called independently like
this:

make <package>-<target>

The package build targets are (in the order they are executed):

+------------------------------------------------------------+
|command/target |Description                                 |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------|

Chapter 6. Developer Guidelines

---------------------------------------------------------------------


6.1. Coding style

--------------

Overall, these coding style rules are here to help you to add new
files in Buildroot or refactor existing ones.

If you slightly modify some existing file, the important thing is to
keep the consistency of the whole file, so you can:

  * either follow the potentially deprecated coding style used in
    this file,
  * or entirely rework it in order to make it comply with these
    rules.

6.1.1. Config.in file

Config.in files contain entries for almost anything configurable in
Buildroot.

An entry has the following pattern:

config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO
        bool "libfoo"
        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAZ
        select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAR
        help
          This is a comment that explains what libfoo is.

          http://foosoftware.org/libfoo/

  * The bool, depends on, select and help lines are indented with one
    tab.
  * The help text itself should be indented with one tab and two
    spaces.

The Config.in files are the input for the configuration tool used in
Buildroot, which is the regular Kconfig. For further details about
the Kconfig language, refer to http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/
kbuild/kconfig-language.txt.

6.1.2. The .mk file

  * Header: The file starts with a header. It contains the module
    name, preferably in lowercase, enclosed between separators made
    of 80 hashes. A blank line is mandatory after the header:

    ################################################################################
    #
    # libfoo
    #
    ################################################################################

  * Assignment: use = preceded and followed by one space:

    LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
    LIBFOO_CONF_OPT += --without-python-support

    It is also possible to align the = signs:

    LIBFOO_VERSION   = 1.0
    LIBFOO_SOURCE    = foo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz
    LIBFOO_CONF_OPT += --without-python-support

  * Indentation: use tab only:

    define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DOC
            $(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/doc \
                    $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/man/man3/libfoo*
    endef

    Note that commands inside a define block should always start with
    a tab, so make recognizes them as commands.

  * Optional dependency:

      o Prefer multi-line syntax.

        YES:

        ifeq ($(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),y)
        LIBFOO_CONF_OPT += --with-python-support
        LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES += python
        else
        LIBFOO_CONF_OPT += --without-python-support
        endif

        NO:

        LIBFOO_CONF_OPT += --with$(if $(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),,out)-python-support
        LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES += $(if $(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),python,)

      o Keep configure options and dependencies close together.
  * Optional hooks: keep hook definition and assignment together in
    one if block.

    YES:

    ifneq ($(BR2_LIBFOO_INSTALL_DATA),y)
    define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
            $(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/data
    endef
    LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS += LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
    endif

    NO:

    define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
            $(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/data
    endef

    ifneq ($(BR2_LIBFOO_INSTALL_DATA),y)
    LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS += LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
    endif

6.1.3. The documentation

The documentation uses the asciidoc format.

For further details about the asciidoc syntax, refer to http://
www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html.


6.2. Adding new packages to Buildroot

--------------

This section covers how new packages (userspace libraries or
applications) can be integrated into Buildroot. It also shows how
existing packages are integrated, which is needed for fixing issues
or tuning their configuration.

6.2.1. Package directory

First of all, create a directory under the package directory for your
software, for example libfoo.

Some packages have been grouped by topic in a sub-directory:
multimedia, x11r7, efl and matchbox. If your package fits in one of
these categories, then create your package directory in these. New
subdirectories are discouraged, however.

6.2.2. Config.in file

Then, create a file named Config.in. This file will contain the
option descriptions related to our libfoo software that will be used
and displayed in the configuration tool. It should basically contain:

config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO
        bool "libfoo"
        help
          This is a comment that explains what libfoo is.

          http://foosoftware.org/libfoo/

The bool line, help line and other meta-informations about the
configuration option must be indented with one tab. The help text
itself should be indented with one tab and two spaces, and it must
mention the upstream URL of the project.

You can add other sub-options into a if BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO…endif
statement to configure particular things in your software. You can
look at examples in other packages. The syntax of the Config.in file
is the same as the one for the kernel Kconfig file. The documentation
for this syntax is available at http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/
kbuild/kconfig-language.txt

Finally you have to add your new libfoo/Config.in to package/
Config.in (or in a category subdirectory if you decided to put your
package in one of the existing categories). The files included there
are sorted alphabetically per category and are NOT supposed to
contain anything but the bare name of the package.

source "package/libfoo/Config.in"

6.2.2.1. Choosing depends on or select

The Config.in file of your package must also ensure that dependencies
are enabled. Typically, Buildroot uses the following rules:

  * Use a select type of dependency for dependencies on libraries.
    These dependencies are generally not obvious and it therefore
    make sense to have the kconfig system ensure that the
    dependencies are selected. For example, the libgtk2 package uses
    select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGLIB2 to make sure this library is also
    enabled. The select keyword express the dependency with a
    backward semantic.
  * Use a depends on type of dependency when the user really needs to
    be aware of the dependency. Typically, Buildroot uses this type
    of dependency for dependencies on toolchain options (target
    architecture, MMU support, C library, C++ support, large file
    support, thread support, RPC support, IPV6 support, WCHAR
    support), or for dependencies on "big" things, such as the X.org
    system. For dependencies on toolchain options, there should be a
    comment that is displayed when the option is not enabled, so that
    the user knows why the package is not available. The depends on
    keyword express the dependency with a forward semantic.

Note. The current problem with the kconfig language is that these two
dependency semantics are not internally linked. Therefore, it may be
possible to select a package, whom one of its dependencies/
requirement is not met.

An example illustrates both the usage of select and depends on.

config BR2_PACKAGE_ACL
        bool "acl"
        select BR2_PACKAGE_ATTR
        depends on BR2_LARGEFILE
        help
          POSIX Access Control Lists, which are used to define more
          fine-grained discretionary access rights for files and
          directories.
          This package also provides libacl.

          http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/acl

comment "acl requires a toolchain with LARGEFILE support"
        depends on !BR2_LARGEFILE

Note that these two dependency types are only transitive with the
dependencies of the same kind.

This means, in the following example:

config BR2_PACKAGE_A
        bool "Package A"

config BR2_PACKAGE_B
        bool "Package B"
        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A

config BR2_PACKAGE_C
        bool "Package C"
        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_B

config BR2_PACKAGE_D
        bool "Package D"
        select BR2_PACKAGE_B

config BR2_PACKAGE_E
        bool "Package E"
        select BR2_PACKAGE_D

  * Selecting Package C will be visible if Package B has been
    selected, which in turn is only visible if Package A has been
    selected.
  * Selecting Package E will select Package D, which will select
    Package B, it will not check for the dependencies of Package B,
    so it will not select Package A.
  * Since Package B is selected but Package A is not, this violates
    the dependency of Package B on Package A. Therefore, in such a
    situation, the transitive dependency has to be added explicitly:

config BR2_PACKAGE_D
        bool "Package D"
        select BR2_PACKAGE_B
        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A

config BR2_PACKAGE_E
        bool "Package E"
        select BR2_PACKAGE_D
        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A

Overall, for package library dependencies, select should be
preferred.

Note that such dependencies will ensure that the dependency option is
also enabled, but not necessarily built before your package. To do
so, the dependency also needs to be expressed in the .mk file of the
package.

Further formatting details: see the coding style Section 6.1.1,
“Config.in file”.

6.2.3. The .mk file

Finally, here’s the hardest part. Create a file named libfoo.mk. It
describes how the package should be downloaded, configured, built,
installed, etc.

Depending on the package type, the .mk file must be written in a
different way, using different infrastructures:

  * Makefiles for generic packages (not using autotools or CMake):
    These are based on an infrastructure similar to the one used for
    autotools-based packages, but require a little more work from the
    developer. They specify what should be done for the
    configuration, compilation, installation and cleanup of the
    package. This infrastructure must be used for all packages that
    do not use the autotools as their build system. In the future,
    other specialized infrastructures might be written for other
    build systems. We cover them through in a tutorial
    Section 6.2.4.1, “generic-package Tutorial” and a reference
    Section 6.2.4.2, “generic-package Reference”.
  * Makefiles for autotools-based software (autoconf, automake,
    etc.): We provide a dedicated infrastructure for such packages,
    since autotools is a very common build system. This
    infrastructure must be used for new packages that rely on the
    autotools as their build system. We cover them through a tutorial
    Section 6.2.5.1, “autotools-package tutorial” and reference
    Section 6.2.5.2, “autotools-package reference”.
  * Makefiles for cmake-based software: We provide a dedicated
    infrastructure for such packages, as CMake is a more and more
    commonly used build system and has a standardized behaviour. This
    infrastructure must be used for new packages that rely on CMake.
    We cover them through a tutorial Section 6.2.6.1, “cmake-package
    tutorial” and reference Section 6.2.6.2, “cmake-package
    reference”.

Further formating details: see the writing rules Section 6.1.2, “The
.mk file”.

6.2.4. Infrastructure for packages with specific build systems

By packages with specific build systems we mean all the packages
whose build system is not one of the standard ones, such as autotools
or CMake. This typically includes packages whose build system is
based on hand-written Makefiles or shell scripts.

The Makefile begins on line 7 to 11 with metadata information: the

containing the package (LIBFOO_SOURCE) the Internet location at which
the tarball can be downloaded from (LIBFOO_SITE), the license
(LIBFOO_LICENSE) and file with the license text
(LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES). All variables must start with the same
prefix, LIBFOO_ in this case. This prefix is always the uppercased
version of the package name (see below to understand where the

On line 12, we specify that this package wants to install something
to the staging space. This is often needed for libraries, since they
must install header files and other development files in the staging
space. This will ensure that the commands listed in the
LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS variable will be executed.

On line 13, we specify that there is some fixing to be done to some
of the libfoo-config files that were installed during
LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS phase. These *-config files are
executable shell script files that are located in $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/
bin directory and are executed by other 3rd party packages to find
out the location and the linking flags of this particular package.

The problem is that all these *-config files by default give wrong,
host system linking flags that are unsuitable for cross-compiling.

For example: -I/usr/include instead of -I$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/include
or: -L/usr/lib instead of -L$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/lib

So some sed magic is done to these scripts to make them give correct
flags. The argument to be given to LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS is the file
name(s) of the shell script(s) needing fixing. All these names are
relative to $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin and if needed multiple names can
be given.

In addition, the scripts listed in LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS are removed
from $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin, since they are not needed on the target.

Example 6.1. Config script: divine package

Package divine installs shell script $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin/
divine-config.

So its fixup would be:

DIVINE_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = divine-config


Example 6.2. Config script: imagemagick package:

Package imagemagick installs the following scripts: $(STAGING_DIR)/
usr/bin/{Magick,Magick++,MagickCore,MagickWand,Wand}-config

So it’s fixup would be:

IMAGEMAGICK_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = \
   Magick-config Magick++-config \
   MagickCore-config MagickWand-config Wand-config


On line 14, we specify the list of dependencies this package relies
on. These dependencies are listed in terms of lower-case package
names, which can be packages for the target (without the host-
prefix) or packages for the host (with the host-) prefix). Buildroot
will ensure that all these packages are built and installed before
the current package starts its configuration.

The rest of the Makefile, lines 16..29, defines what should be done
at the different steps of the package configuration, compilation and
installation. LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS tells what steps should be performed
to build the package. LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS tells what steps
should be performed to install the package in the staging space.
LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS tells what steps should be performed to
install the package in the target space.

All these steps rely on the $(@D) variable, which contains the
directory where the source code of the package has been extracted.

On line 31..33, we define a device-node file used by this package
(LIBFOO_DEVICES).

On line 35..37, we define the permissions to set to specific files
installed by this package (LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS).

On lines 39..41, we define a user that is used by this package (eg.
to run a daemon as non-root) (LIBFOO_USERS).

Finally, on line 43, we call the generic-package function, which
generates, according to the variables defined previously, all the
Makefile code necessary to make your package working.

6.2.4.2. generic-package Reference

There are two variants of the generic target. The generic-package
macro is used for packages to be cross-compiled for the target. The
host-generic-package macro is used for host packages, natively
compiled for the host. It is possible to call both of them in a
single .mk file: once to create the rules to generate a target
package and once to create the rules to generate a host package:

$(eval $(generic-package))
$(eval $(host-generic-package))

This might be useful if the compilation of the target package
requires some tools to be installed on the host. If the package name
is libfoo, then the name of the package for the target is also
libfoo, while the name of the package for the host is host-libfoo.
These names should be used in the DEPENDENCIES variables of other
packages, if they depend on libfoo or host-libfoo.

The call to the generic-package and/or host-generic-package macro 
must be at the end of the .mk file, after all variable definitions.

For the target package, the generic-package uses the variables
defined by the .mk file and prefixed by the uppercased package name:
LIBFOO_*. host-generic-package uses the HOST_LIBFOO_* variables. For 
some variables, if the HOST_LIBFOO_ prefixed variable doesn’t exist,
the package infrastructure uses the corresponding variable prefixed
by LIBFOO_. This is done for variables that are likely to have the
same value for both the target and host packages. See below for
details.

The list of variables that can be set in a .mk file to give metadata
information is (assuming the package name is libfoo) :

  * LIBFOO_VERSION, mandatory, must contain the version of the
    package. Note that if HOST_LIBFOO_VERSION doesn’t exist, it is
    assumed to be the same as LIBFOO_VERSION. It can also be a
    revision number, branch or tag for packages that are fetched
    directly from their revision control system. Examples:
    LIBFOO_VERSION = 0.1.2 LIBFOO_VERSION =
    cb9d6aa9429e838f0e54faa3d455bcbab5eef057 LIBFOO_VERSION = stable
  * LIBFOO_SOURCE may contain the name of the tarball of the package.
    If HOST_LIBFOO_SOURCE is not specified, it defaults to
    LIBFOO_SOURCE. If none are specified, then the value is assumed
    to be packagename-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz. Example:
    LIBFOO_SOURCE = foobar-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.bz2
  * LIBFOO_PATCH may contain a space-separated list of patch file
    names, that will be downloaded from the same location as the
    tarball indicated in LIBFOO_SOURCE, and then applied to the
    package source code. If HOST_LIBFOO_PATCH is not specified, it
    defaults to LIBFOO_PATCH. Note that patches that are included in
    Buildroot itself use a different mechanism: all files of the form
    <packagename>-*.patch present in the package directory inside
    Buildroot will be applied to the package after extraction (see
    patching a package Section 6.3, “Patching a package”). Finally,
    patches listed in the LIBFOO_PATCH variable are applied before
    the patches stored in the Buildroot package directory.
  * LIBFOO_SITE provides the location of the package, which can be a
    URL or a local filesystem path. HTTP, FTP and SCP are supported
    URL types for retrieving package tarballs. Git, Subversion,
    Mercurial, and Bazaar are supported URL types for retrieving
    packages directly from source code management systems. A
    filesystem path may be used to specify either a tarball or a
    directory containing the package source code. See
    LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD below for more details on how retrieval works.
    Note that SCP URLs should be of the form scp://[user@]
    host:filepath, and that filepath is relative to the user’s home
    directory, so you may want to prepend the path with a slash for
    absolute paths: scp://[user@]host:/absolutepath. If
    HOST_LIBFOO_SITE is not specified, it defaults to LIBFOO_SITE.
    Examples: LIBFOO_SITE=http://www.libfoosoftware.org/libfoo
    LIBFOO_SITE=http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor/ LIBFOO_SITE=git://
    github.com/kergoth/tslib.git LIBFOO_SITE=/opt/software/
    libfoo.tar.gz LIBFOO_SITE=$(TOPDIR)/../src/libfoo/
  * LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD determines the method used to fetch or copy
    the package source code. In many cases, Buildroot guesses the
    method from the contents of LIBFOO_SITE and setting
    LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD is unnecessary. When HOST_LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD
    is not specified, it defaults to the value of LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD.
    The possible values of LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD are:

      o wget for normal FTP/HTTP downloads of tarballs. Used by
        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with http://, https:// or
        ftp://.
      o scp for downloads of tarballs over SSH with scp. Used by
        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with scp://.
      o svn for retrieving source code from a Subversion repository.
        Used by default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with svn://. When a
        http:// Subversion repository URL is specified in
        LIBFOO_SITE, one must specify LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=svn.
        Buildroot performs a checkout which is preserved as a tarball
        in the download cache; subsequent builds use the tarball
        instead of performing another checkout.
      o git for retrieving source code from a Git repository. Used by
        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with git://. The downloaded
        source code is cached as with the svn method.
      o hg for retrieving source code from a Mercurial repository.
        One must specify LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=hg when LIBFOO_SITE
        contains a Mercurial repository URL. The downloaded source
        code is cached as with the svn method.
      o bzr for retrieving source code from a Bazaar repository. Used
        by default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with bzr://. The
        downloaded source code is cached as with the svn method.
      o file for a local tarball. One should use this when
        LIBFOO_SITE specifies a package tarball as a local filename.
        Useful for software that isn’t available publicly or in
        version control.
      o local for a local source code directory. One should use this
        when LIBFOO_SITE specifies a local directory path containing
        the package source code. Buildroot copies the contents of the
        source directory into the package’s build directory.
  * LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES lists the dependencies (in terms of package
    name) that are required for the current target package to
    compile. These dependencies are guaranteed to be compiled and
    installed before the configuration of the current package starts.
    In a similar way, HOST_LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES lists the dependencies
    for the current host package.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING can be set to YES or NO (default). If set
    to YES, then the commands in the LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS
    variables are executed to install the package into the staging
    directory.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET can be set to YES (default) or NO. If set
    to YES, then the commands in the LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
    variables are executed to install the package into the target
    directory.
  * LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS lists the names of the files in $
    (STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin that need some special fixing to make them
    cross-compiling friendly. Multiple file names separated by space
    can be given and all are relative to $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin. The
    files listed in LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS are also removed from $
    (TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin since they are not needed on the target.
  * LIBFOO_DEVICES lists the device files to be created by Buildroot
    when using the static device table. The syntax to use is the
    makedevs one. You can find some documentation for this syntax in
    the Section 11.1, “Makedev syntax documentation”. This variable
    is optional.
  * LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS lists the changes of permissions to be done at
    the end of the build process. The syntax is once again the
    makedevs one. You can find some documentation for this syntax in
    the Section 11.1, “Makedev syntax documentation”. This variable
    is optional.
  * LIBFOO_USERS lists the users to create for this package, if it
    installs a program you want to run as a specific user (eg. as a
    daemon, or as a cron-job). The syntax is similar in spirit to the
    makedevs one, and is described in the Section 11.2, “Makeuser
    syntax documentation”. This variable is optional.
  * LIBFOO_LICENSE defines the license (or licenses) under which the
    package is released. This name will appear in the manifest file
    produced by make legal-info. If the license appears in the
    following list Section 7.2, “License abbreviations”, use the same
    string to make the manifest file uniform. Otherwise, describe the
    license in a precise and concise way, avoiding ambiguous names
    such as BSD which actually name a family of licenses. This
    variable is optional. If it is not defined, unknown will appear
    in the license field of the manifest file for this package.
  * LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES is a space-separated list of files in the
    package tarball that contain the license(s) under which the
    package is released. make legal-info copies all of these files in
    the legal-info directory. See Chapter 7, Legal notice and
    licensing for more information. This variable is optional. If it
    is not defined, a warning will be produced to let you know, and
    not saved will appear in the license files field of the manifest
    file for this package.
  * LIBFOO_REDISTRIBUTE can be set to YES (default) or NO to indicate
    if the package source code is allowed to be redistributed. Set it
    to NO for non-opensource packages: Buildroot will not save the
    source code for this package when collecting the legal-info.
  * LIBFOO_FLAT_STACKSIZE defines the stack size of an application
    built into the FLAT binary format. The application stack size on
    the NOMMU architecture processors can’t be enlarged at run time.
    The default stack size for the FLAT binary format is only 4k
    bytes. If the application consumes more stack, append the
    required number here.

The recommended way to define these variables is to use the following
syntax:

LIBFOO_VERSION = 2.32

Now, the variables that define what should be performed at the
different steps of the build process.

  * LIBFOO_EXTRACT_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to extract
    the package. This is generally not needed as tarballs are
    automatically handled by Buildroot. However, if the package uses
    a non-standard archive format, such as a ZIP or RAR file, or has
    a tarball with a non-standard organization, this variable allows
    to override the package infrastructure default behavior.
  * LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
    configure the package before its compilation.
  * LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to compile
    the package.
  * HOST_LIBFOO_INSTALL_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
    install the package, when the package is a host package. The
    package must install its files to the directory given by $
    (HOST_DIR). All files, including development files such as
    headers should be installed, since other packages might be
    compiled on top of this package.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
    install the package to the target directory, when the package is
    a target package. The package must install its files to the
    directory given by $(TARGET_DIR). Only the files required for 
    execution of the package have to be installed. Header files,
    static libraries and documentation will be removed again when the
    target filesystem is finalized.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
    install the package to the staging directory, when the package is
    a target package. The package must install its files to the
    directory given by $(STAGING_DIR). All development files should
    be installed, since they might be needed to compile other
    packages.
  * LIBFOO_CLEAN_CMDS, lists the actions to perform to clean up the
    build directory of the package.
  * LIBFOO_UNINSTALL_TARGET_CMDS lists the actions to uninstall the
    package from the target directory $(TARGET_DIR)
  * LIBFOO_UNINSTALL_STAGING_CMDS lists the actions to uninstall the
    package from the staging directory $(STAGING_DIR).
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSV and LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSTEMD list the
    actions to install init scripts either for the systemV-like init
    systems (busybox, sysvinit, etc.) or for the systemd units. These
    commands will be run only when the relevant init system is
    installed (i.e. if systemd is selected as the init system in the
    configuration, only LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSTEMD will be run).

The preferred way to define these variables is:

define LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS
        action 1
        action 2
        action 3
endef

In the action definitions, you can use the following variables:

  * $(@D), which contains the directory in which the package source
    code has been uncompressed.
  * $(TARGET_CC), $(TARGET_LD), etc. to get the target
    cross-compilation utilities
  * $(TARGET_CROSS) to get the cross-compilation toolchain prefix
  * Of course the $(HOST_DIR), $(STAGING_DIR) and $(TARGET_DIR)
    variables to install the packages properly.

The last feature of the generic infrastructure is the ability to add
hooks. These define further actions to perform after existing steps.
Most hooks aren’t really useful for generic packages, since the .mk
file already has full control over the actions performed in each step
of the package construction. The hooks are more useful for packages
using the autotools infrastructure described below. However, since
they are provided by the generic infrastructure, they are documented
here. The exception is LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS. Patching the package
and producing legal info are not user definable, so
LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS and LIBFOO_POST_LEGAL_INFO_HOOKS are useful
for generic packages.

The following hook points are available:

  * LIBFOO_POST_DOWNLOAD_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_POST_EXTRACT_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_PRE_PATCH_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_PRE_CONFIGURE_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_POST_CONFIGURE_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_POST_BUILD_HOOKS
  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_HOOKS (for host packages only)
  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_STAGING_HOOKS (for target packages only)
  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS (for target packages only)
  * LIBFOO_POST_LEGAL_INFO_HOOKS

These variables are lists of variable names containing actions to be
performed at this hook point. This allows several hooks to be
registered at a given hook point. Here is an example:

define LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_FIXUP
        action1
        action2
endef

LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS += LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_FIXUP

6.2.5. Infrastructure for autotools-based packages

6.2.5.1. autotools-package tutorial

First, let’s see how to write a .mk file for an autotools-based
package, with an example :

01: ################################################################################
02: #
03: # libfoo
04: #
05: ################################################################################
06:
07: LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
08: LIBFOO_SOURCE = libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz
09: LIBFOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
10: LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING = YES
11: LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET = NO
12: LIBFOO_CONF_OPT = --disable-shared
13: LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES = libglib2 host-pkgconf
14:
15: $(eval $(autotools-package))

On line 7, we declare the version of the package.

On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball and the location
of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot will automatically download the
tarball from this location.

On line 10, we tell Buildroot to install the package to the staging
directory. The staging directory, located in output/staging/ is the
directory where all the packages are installed, including their
development files, etc. By default, packages are not installed to the
staging directory, since usually, only libraries need to be installed
in the staging directory: their development files are needed to
compile other libraries or applications depending on them. Also by
default, when staging installation is enabled, packages are installed
in this location using the make install command.

On line 11, we tell Buildroot to not install the package to the
target directory. This directory contains what will become the root
filesystem running on the target. For purely static libraries, it is
not necessary to install them in the target directory because they
will not be used at runtime. By default, target installation is
enabled; setting this variable to NO is almost never needed. Also by
default, packages are installed in this location using the make
install command.

On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass a custom configure option, that
will be passed to the ./configure script before configuring and
building the package.

On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
before the build process of our package starts.

Finally, on line line 15, we invoke the autotools-package macro that
generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the package to
be built.

6.2.5.2. autotools-package reference

The main macro of the autotools package infrastructure is
autotools-package. It is similar to the generic-package macro. The
ability to have target and host packages is also available, with the
host-autotools-package macro.

Just like the generic infrastructure, the autotools infrastructure
works by defining a number of variables before calling the
autotools-package macro.

First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
the generic infrastructure also exist in the autotools
infrastructure: LIBFOO_VERSION, LIBFOO_SOURCE, LIBFOO_PATCH,
LIBFOO_SITE, LIBFOO_SUBDIR, LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES,
LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING, LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET.

A few additional variables, specific to the autotools infrastructure,
can also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific
cases, typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.

  * LIBFOO_SUBDIR may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
    package that contains the configure script. This is useful, if
    for example, the main configure script is not at the root of the
    tree extracted by the tarball. If HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR is not
    specified, it defaults to LIBFOO_SUBDIR.
  * LIBFOO_CONF_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
    pass to the configure script. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_CONF_OPT, to specify additional configure options to pass
    to the configure script. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_MAKE, to specify an alternate make command. This is
    typically useful when parallel make is enabled in the
    configuration (using BR2_JLEVEL) but that this feature should be
    disabled for the given package, for one reason or another. By
    default, set to $(MAKE). If parallel building is not supported by
    the package, then it should be set to LIBFOO_MAKE=$(MAKE1).
  * LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
    pass to make in the build step. These are passed before the make
    command. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_MAKE_OPT, to specify additional variables to pass to make
    in the build step. These are passed after the make command. By
    default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_AUTORECONF, tells whether the package should be
    autoreconfigured or not (i.e, if the configure script and
    Makefile.in files should be re-generated by re-running autoconf,
    automake, libtool, etc.). Valid values are YES and NO. By
    default, the value is NO
  * LIBFOO_AUTORECONF_OPT to specify additional options passed to the
    autoreconf program if LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=YES. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_LIBTOOL_PATCH tells whether the Buildroot patch to fix
    libtool cross-compilation issues should be applied or not. Valid
    values are YES and NO. By default, the value is YES
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPT contains the make options used to
    install the package to the staging directory. By default, the
    value is DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) install, which is correct for
    most autotools packages. It is still possible to override it.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPT contains the make options used to
    install the package to the target directory. By default, the
    value is DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) install. The default value is
    correct for most autotools packages, but it is still possible to
    override it if needed.
  * LIBFOO_CLEAN_OPT contains the make options used to clean the
    package. By default, the value is clean.
  * LIBFOO_UNINSTALL_STAGING_OPT, contains the make options used to
    uninstall the package from the staging directory. By default, the
    value is DESTDIR=$$(STAGING_DIR) uninstall.
  * LIBFOO_UNINSTALL_TARGET_OPT, contains the make options used to
    uninstall the package from the target directory. By default, the
    value is DESTDIR=$$(TARGET_DIR) uninstall.

With the autotools infrastructure, all the steps required to build
and install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
well for most autotools-based packages. However, when required, it is
still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:

  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
    build or install). See the reference documentation of the generic
    infrastructure for details.
  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the
    autotools infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines
    its own LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS variable, it will be used instead
    of the default autotools one. However, using this method should
    be restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the
    general case.

6.2.6. Infrastructure for CMake-based packages

6.2.6.1. cmake-package tutorial

First, let’s see how to write a .mk file for a CMake-based package,
with an example :

01: ################################################################################
02: #
03: # libfoo
04: #
05: ################################################################################
06:
07: LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0

10: LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING = YES
11: LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET = NO
12: LIBFOO_CONF_OPT = -DBUILD_DEMOS=ON
13: LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES = libglib2 host-pkgconf
14:
15: $(eval $(cmake-package))

On line 7, we declare the version of the package.

On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball and the location
of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot will automatically download the
tarball from this location.

On line 10, we tell Buildroot to install the package to the staging
directory. The staging directory, located in output/staging/ is the
directory where all the packages are installed, including their
development files, etc. By default, packages are not installed to the
staging directory, since usually, only libraries need to be installed
in the staging directory: their development files are needed to
compile other libraries or applications depending on them. Also by
default, when staging installation is enabled, packages are installed
in this location using the make install command.

On line 11, we tell Buildroot to not install the package to the
target directory. This directory contains what will become the root
filesystem running on the target. For purely static libraries, it is
not necessary to install them in the target directory because they
will not be used at runtime. By default, target installation is
enabled; setting this variable to NO is almost never needed. Also by
default, packages are installed in this location using the make
install command.

On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass custom options to CMake when it
is configuring the package.

On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
before the build process of our package starts.

Finally, on line line 15, we invoke the cmake-package macro that
generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the package to
be built.

  * LIBFOO_SUBDIR may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
    package that contains the main CMakeLists.txt file. This is
    useful, if for example, the main CMakeLists.txt file is not at
    the root of the tree extracted by the tarball. If
    HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR is not specified, it defaults to
    LIBFOO_SUBDIR.
  * LIBFOO_CONF_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
    pass to CMake. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_CONF_OPT, to specify additional configure options to pass
    to CMake. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_MAKE, to specify an alternate make command. This is
    typically useful when parallel make is enabled in the
    configuration (using BR2_JLEVEL) but that this feature should be
    disabled for the given package, for one reason or another. By
    default, set to $(MAKE). If parallel building is not supported by
    the package, then it should be set to LIBFOO_MAKE=$(MAKE1).
  * LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
    pass to make in the build step. These are passed before the make
    command. By default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_MAKE_OPT, to specify additional variables to pass to make
    in the build step. These are passed after the make command. By
    default, empty.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPT contains the make options used to
    install the package to the staging directory. By default, the
    value is DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) install, which is correct for
    most CMake packages. It is still possible to override it.
  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPT contains the make options used to
    install the package to the target directory. By default, the
    value is DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) install. The default value is
    correct for most CMake packages, but it is still possible to
    override it if needed.
  * LIBFOO_CLEAN_OPT contains the make options used to clean the
    package. By default, the value is clean.

With the CMake infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
well for most CMake-based packages. However, when required, it is
still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:

  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
    build or install). See the reference documentation of the generic
    infrastructure for details.
  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the CMake
    infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines its own
    LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS variable, it will be used instead of the
    default CMake one. However, using this method should be
    restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the general
    case.

6.2.7. Gettext integration and interaction with packages

Many packages that support internationalization use the gettext
library. Dependencies for this library are fairly complicated and
therefore, deserve some explanation.

The uClibc C library doesn’t implement gettext functionality;
therefore with this C library, a separate gettext must be compiled.
On the other hand, the glibc C library does integrate its own
gettext, and in this case the separate gettext library should not be
compiled, because it creates various kinds of build failures.

Additionally, some packages (such as libglib2) do require gettext
unconditionally, while other packages (those who support
--disable-nls in general) only require gettext when locale support is
enabled.

Therefore, Buildroot defines two configuration options:

  * BR2_NEEDS_GETTEXT, which is true as soon as the toolchain doesn’t
    provide its own gettext implementation
  * BR2_NEEDS_GETTEXT_IF_LOCALE, which is true if the toolchain
    doesn’t provide its own gettext implementation and if locale
    support is enabled

Packages that need gettext only when locale support is enabled
should:

  * use select BR2_PACKAGE_GETTEXT if BR2_NEEDS_GETTEXT_IF_LOCALE in
    the Config.in file;
  * use $(if $(BR2_NEEDS_GETTEXT_IF_LOCALE),gettext) in the package
    DEPENDENCIES variable in the .mk file.

Packages that unconditionally need gettext (which should be very
rare) should:

  * use select BR2_PACKAGE_GETTEXT if BR2_NEEDS_GETTEXT in the
    Config.in file;
  * use $(if $(BR2_NEEDS_GETTEXT),gettext) in the package
    DEPENDENCIES variable in the .mk file.

6.2.8. Tips and tricks

6.2.8.1. Package name, config entry name and makefile variable
relationship

In Buildroot, there is some relationship between:

  * the package name, which is the package directory name (and the
    name of the *.mk file);
  * the config entry name that is declared in the Config.in file;
  * the makefile variable prefix.

It is mandatory to maintain consistency between these elements, using
the following rules:

  * the package directory and the *.mk name are the package name
    itself (e.g.: package/foo-bar_boo/foo-bar_boo.mk);
  * the make target name is the package name itself (e.g.:
    foo-bar_boo);
  * the config entry is the upper case package name with . and -
    characters substituted with _, prefixed with BR2_PACKAGE_ (e.g.:
    BR2_PACKAGE_FOO_BAR_BOO);
  * the *.mk file variable prefix is the upper case package name .
    and - characters substituted with _ (e.g.: FOO_BAR_BOO_VERSION).

6.2.8.2. How to add a package from github

Packages on github often don’t have a download area with release
tarballs. However, it is possible to download tarballs directly from
the repository on github.

FOO_VERSION = v1.0 # tag or (abbreviated) commit ID
FOO_SITE = http://github.com/<user>/<package>/tarball/$(FOO_VERSION)

Notes

  * The FOO_VERSION can either be a tag or a commit ID.
  * The tarball name generated by github matches the default one from
    Buildroot (e.g.: foo-1234567.tar.gz), so it is not necessary to
    specify it in the .mk file.
  * When using a commit ID as version, usually the first 7 characters
    of the SHA1 are enough.

6.2.9. Conclusion

As you can see, adding a software package to Buildroot is simply a
matter of writing a Makefile using an existing example and modifying
it according to the compilation process required by the package.

If you package software that might be useful for other people, don’t
forget to send a patch to the Buildroot mailing list (see
Section 10.1, “Submitting patches”)!


6.3. Patching a package

--------------

While integrating a new package or updating an existing one, it may
be necessary to patch the source of the software to get it
cross-built within Buildroot.

Buildroot offers an infrastructure to automatically handle this
during the builds. It supports three ways of applying patch sets:
downloaded patches, patches supplied within buildroot and patches
located in a user-defined global patch directory.

6.3.1. Providing patches

6.3.1.1. Downloaded

If it is necessary to apply a patch that is available for download,
then it to the <packagename>_PATCH variable. It is downloaded from
the same site as the package itself. It can be a single patch, or a
tarball containing a patch series.

This method is typically used for packages from Debian.

6.3.1.2. Within Buildroot

Most patches are provided within Buildroot, in the package directory;
these typically aim to fix cross-compilation, libc support, or other
such issues.

These patch files should be named <packagename>-<number>-
<description>.patch.

A series file, as used by quilt, may also be added in the package
directory. In that case, the series file defines the patch
application order.

Notes

  * The patch files coming with Buildroot should not contain any
    package version reference in their filename.
  * The field <number> in the patch file name refers to the apply
    order.

6.3.1.3. Global patch directory

The BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR configuration file option can be used to
specify a directory containing global package patches. See
Section 3.4.4, “Customizing packages” for details.

6.3.2. How patches are applied

 1. Run the <packagename>_PRE_PATCH_HOOKS commands if defined;
 2. Cleanup the build directory, removing any existing *.rej files;
 3. If <packagename>_PATCH is defined, then patches from these
    tarballs are applied;
 4. If there are some *.patch files in the package directory or in
    the a package subdirectory named <packageversion>, then:

      * If a series file exists in the package directory, then
        patches are applied according to the series file;
      * Otherwise, patch files matching <packagename>-*.patch are
        applied in alphabetical order. So, to ensure they are applied
        in the right order, it is hightly recommended to named the
        patch files like this: <packagename>-<number>-
        <description>.patch, where <number> refers to the apply order
        .
 5. Run the <packagename>_POST_PATCH_HOOKS commands if defined.

If something goes wrong in the steps 3 or 4, then the build fails.

6.3.3. Format and licensing of the package patches

Patches are released under the same license as the software that is
modified.

A message explaining what the patch does, and why it is needed,
should be added in the header commentary of the patch.

You should add a Signed-off-by statement in the header of the each
patch to help with keeping track of the changes and to certify that
the patch is released under the same license as the software that is
modified.

If the software is under version control, it is recommended to use
the upstream SCM software to generate the patch set.

Otherwise, concatenate the header with the output of the diff -purN
package-version.orig/ package-version/ command.

At the end, the patch should look like:

configure.ac: add C++ support test

signed-off-by John Doe <john.doe@noname.org>

--- configure.ac.orig
+++ configure.ac
@@ -40,2 +40,12 @@

+                AC_LANG_POP([C++])])
+
+AM_CONDITIONAL([CXX_WORKS], [test "x$rw_cv_prog_cxx_works" = "xyes"])

6.3.4. Integrating patches found on the Web

When integrating a patch of which you are not the author, you have to
add a few things in the header of the patch itself.

Depending on whether the patch has been obtained from the project
repository itself, or from somewhere on the web, add one of the
following tags:

Backported from: <some commit id>

or

Fetch from: <some url>

It is also sensible to add a few words about any changes to the patch
that may have been necessary.

TODO


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 7. Legal notice and licensing

---------------------------------------------------------------------


7.1. Complying with open source licenses

--------------

All of the end products of Buildroot (toolchain, root filesystem,
kernel, bootloaders) contain open source software, released under
various licenses.

Using open source software gives you the freedom to build rich
embedded systems, choosing from a wide range of packages, but also
imposes some obligations that you must know and honour. Some licenses
require you to publish the license text in the documentation of your
product. Others require you to redistribute the source code of the
software to those that receive your product.

The exact requirements of each license are documented in each
package, and it is your responsibility (or that of your legal office)
to comply with those requirements. To make this easier for you,
Buildroot can collect for you some material you will probably need.
To produce this material, after you have configured Buildroot with
make menuconfig, make xconfig or make gconfig, run:

make legal-info

Buildroot will collect legally-relevant material in your output
directory, under the legal-info/ subdirectory. There you will find:

  * A README file, that summarizes the produced material and contains
    warnings about material that Buildroot could not produce.
  * buildroot.config: this is the Buildroot configuration file that
    is usually produced with make menuconfig, and which is necessary
    to reproduce the build.
  * The source code for all packages; this is saved in the sources/
    subdirectory (except for proprietary packages, whose source code
    is not saved); patches applied to some packages by Buildroot are
    distributed with the Buildroot sources and are not duplicated in
    the sources/ subdirectory.
  * A manifest file listing the configured packages, their version,
    license and related information. Some of this information might
    not be defined in Buildroot; such items are marked as "unknown".
  * A licenses/ subdirectory, which contains the license text of
    packages. If the license file(s) are not defined in Buildroot,
    the file is not produced and a warning in the README indicates
    this.

Please note that the aim of the legal-info feature of Buildroot is to
produce all the material that is somehow relevant for legal
compliance with the package licenses. Buildroot does not try to
produce the exact material that you must somehow make public.
Certainly, more material is produced than is needed for a strict
legal compliance. For example, it produces the source code for
packages released under BSD-like licenses, that you are not required
to redistribute in source form.

Moreover, due to technical limitations, Buildroot does not produce
some material that you will or may need, such as the toolchain source
code and the Buildroot source code itself (including patches to
packages for which source distribution is required). When you run
make legal-info, Buildroot produces warnings in the README file to
inform you of relevant material that could not be saved.


7.2. License abbreviations

--------------

Here is a list of the licenses that are most widely used by packages
in Buildroot, with the name used in the manifest file:

  * GPLv2: GNU General Public License, version 2;
  * GPLv2+: GNU General Public License, version 2 or (at your option)
    any later version;
  * GPLv3: GNU General Public License, version 3;
  * GPLv3+: GNU General Public License, version 3 or (at your option)
    any later version;
  * GPL: GNU General Public License (any version);
  * LGPLv2: GNU Library General Public License, version 2;
  * LGPLv2+: GNU Library General Public License, version 2.1 or (at
    your option) any later version;
  * LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1;
  * LGPLv2.1+: GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or (at
    your option) any later version;
  * LGPLv3: GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3;
  * LGPLv3+: GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or (at your
    option) any later version;
  * LGPL: GNU Lesser General Public License (any version);
  * BSD-4c: Original BSD 4-clause license;
  * BSD-3c: BSD 3-clause license;
  * BSD-2c: BSD 2-clause license;
  * MIT: MIT-style license.


7.3. Complying with the Buildroot license

--------------

Buildroot itself is an open source software, released under the GNU
General Public License, version 2 or (at your option) any later
version. However, being a build system, it is not normally part of
the end product: if you develop the root filesystem, kernel,
bootloader or toolchain for a device, the code of Buildroot is only
present on the development machine, not in the device storage.

Nevertheless, the general view of the Buildroot developers is that
you should release the Buildroot source code along with the source
code of other packages when releasing a product that contains
GPL-licensed software. This is because the GNU GPL defines the "
complete source code" for an executable work as "all the source code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable". Buildroot is part of the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable, and as such it is
considered part of the material that must be redistributed.

Keep in mind that this is only the Buildroot developers' opinion, and
you should consult your legal department or lawyer in case of any
doubt.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 8. Beyond Buildroot

---------------------------------------------------------------------


8.1. Boot the generated images

--------------

8.1.1. NFS boot

To achieve NFS-boot, enable tar root filesystem in the Filesystem
images menu.

After a complete build, just run the following commands to setup the
NFS-root directory:

sudo tar -xavf /path/to/output_dir/rootfs.tar -C /path/to/nfs_root_dir

Remember to add this path to /etc/exports.

Then, you can execute a NFS-boot from your target.


8.2. Chroot

--------------

If you want to chroot in a generated image, then there are few thing
you should be aware of:

  * you should setup the new root from the tar root filesystem image;
  * either the selected target architecture is compatible with your
    host machine, or you should use some qemu-* binary and correctly
    set it within the binfmt properties to be able to run the
    binaries built for the target on your host machine;
  * Buildroot does not currently provide host-qemu and binfmt
    correctly built and set for that kind of use.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 9. Getting involved

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Like any open source project, Buildroot has different ways to share
information in its community and outside.

One piece of it is the document you are currently reading ;-).

Each of those ways may interest you if you are looking for some help,
want to understand Buildroot or contribute to the project.


9.1. Mailing List

--------------

Buildroot has a mailing list http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/
buildroot for discussion and development.

9.1.1. Subscribing to the mailing list

You can subscribe by visiting http://lists.busybox.net/mailman/
listinfo/buildroot. Only subscribers to the Buildroot mailing list
are allowed to post to this list.

The list is also available through Gmane http://gmane.org, at
gmane.comp.lib.uclibc.buildroot http://dir.gmane.org/
gmane.comp.lib.uclibc.buildroot.

9.1.2. Searching the List Archives

Please search the mailing list archives before asking questions on
the mailing list, since there is a good chance someone else has asked
the same question before. Checking the archives is a great way to
avoid annoying everyone on the list with frequently asked questions…


9.2. IRC

--------------

The Buildroot IRC is irc://freenode.net/#buildroot. The channel #
buildroot is hosted on Freenode http://webchat.freenode.net.

When asking for help on IRC, share relevant logs or pieces of code
using a code sharing website.


9.3. Patchwork

--------------

The Buildroot patch management interface is at http://
patchwork.buildroot.org.

All patches and comments sent through the mailing list are
automatically indexed in patchwork.


9.4. Bugtracker

--------------

The Buildroot bugtracker is at https://bugs.busybox.net.

To open a bug, see Section 10.4, “Reporting issues/bugs, get help”.


9.5. Buildroot wikipage

--------------

After the Buildroot developer day on February 3, 2012, a page
dedicated to Buildroot has been created on elinux.org.

This page is reachable at http://elinux.org/Buildroot.

Currently, this page is mainly used as a todo-list.


9.6. Events

--------------

9.6.1. Buildroot Developer Days aside ELC-E 2012 (November 3-4, 2012
- Barcelona)

  * Event page: http://elinux.org/Buildroot:DeveloperDaysELCE2012

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 10. Contributing to Buildroot

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to contribute to Buildroot, you will need a git view of
the project. Refer to Section 2.2, “Getting Buildroot” to get it.

Currently, the mailing list is the central place for contribution. If
you have not already subscribed to it, then refer to Section 9.1.1,
“Subscribing to the mailing list”.

Recently, a web interface is also used to manage patches sent to the
mailing list, see Section 9.3, “Patchwork”.

Note

Please, do not attach patches to bugs, send them to the mailing list
instead (see Section 10.1, “Submitting patches”).


10.1. Submitting patches

--------------

When your changes are done, and committed in your local git view, 
rebase your development branch on top of the upstream tree before
generating the patch set. To do so, run:

$ git fetch --all --tags
$ git rebase origin/master

Here, you are ready to generate then submit your patch set.

To generate it, run:

$ git format-patch -M -n -s -o outgoing origin/master

This will generate patch files in the outgoing subdirectory,
automatically adding the signed-off-by line.

Once patch files are generated, you can review/edit the commit
message before submitting them using your favorite text editor.

Lastly, send/submit your patch set to the Buildroot mailing list:

$ git send-email --to buildroot@busybox.net outgoing/*

Note that git should be configured to use your mail account. To
configure git, see man git-send-email or google it.

Make sure posted patches are not line-wrapped, otherwise they cannot
easily be applied. In such a case, fix your e-mail client, or better,
use git send-email to send your patches.

10.1.1. Cover letter

If you want to present the whole patch set in a separate mail, add
--cover-letter to the git format-patch command (see man
git-format-patch for further information). This will generate a
template for an introduction e-mail to your patch series.

A cover letter may be useful to introduce the changes you propose in
the following cases:

  * large number of commits in the series;
  * deep impact of the changes in the rest of the project;
  * RFC ^[4];
  * whenever you feel it will help presenting your work, your
    choices, the review process, etc.

10.1.2. Patch revision changelog

When improvements are requested, the new revision of each commit
should include a changelog of the modifications between each
submission. Note that when your patch series is introduced by a cover
letter, the changelog may be added in the cover letter rather than in
the individual commits.

When added to the individual commits, this changelog is added when
editing the commit message. Below the Signed-off-by section, add ---
and your changelog.

Although the changelog will be visible for the reviewers in the mail
thread, as well as in patchwork, git will automatically ignores lines
below --- when the patch will be merged. This is the intended
behavior: the changelog is not meant to be preserved forever in the
git history of the project.

Hereafter the recommended layout:

Patch title less than 80-character length

Some more paragraph giving some more details.

And yet another paragraph giving more details.

Signed-off-by John Doe <john.doe@noname.org>
---
Changes v2 -> v3:
  - foo bar  (suggested by Jane)
  - bar buz

Changes v1 -> v2:
  - alpha bravo  (suggested by John)
  - charly delta

Any patch revision should include the version number. The version
number is simply composed of the letter v followed by an integer
greater or equal to two (i.e. "PATCH v2", "PATCH v3" …).

This can be easily handled with git format-patch by using the option
--subject-prefix:

$ git format-patch --subject-prefix "PATCH v4" \
    -M -o outgoing origin/master


10.2. Reviewing/Testing patches

--------------

In the review process, do not hesitate to respond to patch
submissions for remarks, suggestions or anything that will help
everyone to understand the patches and make them better.

Some tags are used to help following the state of any patch posted on
the mailing-list:

Acked-by
    Indicates that the patch can be committed.
Tested-by
    Indicates that the patch has been tested. It is useful but not
    necessary to add a comment about what has been tested.


10.3. Autobuild

--------------

The Buildroot community is currently setting up automatic builds in
order to test more and more configurations. All build results are
available at http://autobuild.buildroot.org

A good way to contribute is by fixing broken builds.

In the commit message of a patch fixing an autobuild, add a reference
to the build result directory (the dir link in the data column):

Fixes http://autobuild.buildroot.org/results/51000a9d4656afe9e0ea6f07b9f8ed374c2e4069


10.4. Reporting issues/bugs, get help

--------------

Before reporting any issue, please check the mailing list archive
Section 9.1.1, “Subscribing to the mailing list” in case someone has
already reported and fixed a similar problem.

However you choose to report bugs or get help, opening a bug
Section 9.4, “Bugtracker” or send a mail to the mailing list
Section 9.1.1, “Subscribing to the mailing list”, there are a number
of details to provide in order to help people reproduce and find a
solution to the issue.

Try to think as if you were trying to help someone else; in that
case, what would you need?

Here is a short list of details to provide in such case:

  * host machine (OS/release)
  * version of Buildroot
  * target for which the build fails
  * package(s) which the build fails
  * the command that fails and its output
  * any information you think that may be relevant

Additionnally, your can add the .config file.

If some of these details are too large, do not hesitate to use a
pastebin service (see http://www.similarsitesearch.com/
alternatives-to/pastebin.com).

^[4] RFC: (Request for comments) change proposal


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 11. Appendix

---------------------------------------------------------------------


11.1. Makedev syntax documentation

--------------

The makedev syntax is used in several places in Buildroot to define
changes to be made for permissions, or which device files to create
and how to create them, in order to avoid calls to mknod.

This syntax is derived from the makedev utility, and more complete
documentation can be found in the package/makedevs/README file.

It takes the form of a line for each file, with the following layout:

+--------------------------------------------------+
|name|type|mode|uid|gid|major|minor|start|inc|count|
+--------------------------------------------------+

There are a few non-trivial blocks here:

  * name is the path to the file you want to create/modify
  * type is the type of the file, being one of:

      o f: a regular file
      o d: a directory
      o c: a character device file
      o b: a block device file
      o p: a named pipe
  * mode, uid and gid are the usual permissions settings
  * major and minor are here for device files - set to - for other
    files
  * start, inc and count are for when you want to create a batch of
    files, and can be reduced to a loop, beginning at start,
    incrementing its counter by inc until it reaches count

Let’s say you want to change the permissions of a given file; using
this syntax, you will need to put:

/usr/bin/foobar f       644     0       0       -       -       -       -       -

On the other hand, if you want to create the device file /dev/hda and
the corresponding 15 files for the partitions, you will need for /dev
/hda:

/dev/hda        b       640     0       0       3       0       0       0       -

11.2. Makeuser syntax documentation

--------------

The syntax to create users is inspired by the makedev syntax, above,
but is specific to Buildroot.

The syntax for adding a user is a space-separated list of fields, one
user per line; the fields are:

+---------------------------------------------------------+
|username|uid|group|gid|password|home|shell|groups|comment|
+---------------------------------------------------------+

Where:

  * username is the desired user name (aka login name) for the user.
    It can not be root, and must be unique.
  * uid is the desired UID for the user. It must be unique, and not
    0. If set to -1, then a unique UID will be computed by Buildroot
    in the range [1000…1999]
  * group is the desired name for the user’s main group. It can not
    be root. If the group does not exist, it will be created.
  * gid is the desired GID for the user’s main group. It must be
    unique, and not 0. If set to -1, and the group does not already
    exist, then a unique GID will be computed by Buildroot in the
    range [1000..1999]
  * password is the crypt(3)-encoded password. If prefixed with !,
    then login is disabled. If prefixed with =, then it is
    interpreted as clear-text, and will be crypt-encoded (using MD5).
    If prefixed with !=, then the password will be crypt-encoded
    (using MD5) and login will be disabled. If set to *, then login
    is not allowed.
  * home is the desired home directory for the user. If set to -, no
    home directory will be created, and the user’s home will be /.
    Explicitly setting home to / is not allowed.
  * shell is the desired shell for the user. If set to -, then /bin/
    false is set as the user’s shell.
  * groups is the comma-separated list of additional groups the user
    should be part of. If set to -, then the user will be a member of
    no additional group. Missing groups will be created with an
    arbitrary gid.
  * comment (aka GECOS field) is an almost-free-form text.

There are a few restrictions on the content of each field:

  * except for comment, all fields are mandatory.
  * except for comment, fields may not contain spaces.
  * no field may contain a colon (:).

If home is not -, then the home directory, and all files below, will
belong to the user and its main group.

Examples:

foo -1 bar -1 !=blabla /home/foo /bin/sh alpha,bravo Foo user

This will create this user:

  * username (aka login name) is: foo
  * uid is computed by Buildroot
  * main group is: bar
  * main group gid is computed by Buildroot
  * clear-text password is: blabla, will be crypt(3)-encoded, and
    login is disabled.
  * home is: /home/foo
  * shell is: /bin/sh
  * foo is also a member of groups: alpha and bravo
  * comment is: Foo user

test 8000 wheel -1 = - /bin/sh - Test user

This will create this user:

  * username (aka login name) is: test
  * uid is : 8000
  * main group is: wheel
  * main group gid is computed by Buildroot, and will use the value
    defined in the rootfs skeleton
  * password is empty (aka no password).
  * home is / but will not belong to test
  * shell is: /bin/sh
  * test is not a member of any additional groups
  * comment is: Test user
